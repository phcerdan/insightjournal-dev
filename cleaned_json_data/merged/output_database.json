   "abstract": "In this article, we will present a novel interactive image registration technique using the 3D volumetric view as guidance throughout the registration process. The registration criterion used in this technique is the homogeneity of the color distribution on any given anatomic landmark, usually the skin/muscle voxels. This registration criterion has been validated using two different approaches, including comparison with automatic registration using mutual information based on the Insight Toolkits (ITK) and comparison with registered MR images with different pulse sequences acquired directly from the same MR scanner less than 5 minutes. An investigation is also made to compare this technique with the conventional interactive image registration using three orthogonal planar (3P) views, which is predominantly used in the current treatment planning in clinic. This 3D technique has shown several advantages, including improved registration accuracy and accelerated registration speed. It has also found that the 3P pixel registration technique often \"inherits\" a global positioning error, due to its partial 3D visual presentation. In addition, unlike the 3P technique, which generally cannot be used to register more than 2 images simultaneously and low resolution PET images, this 3D technique can register up to 4 imaging modalities simultaneously, including PET images, with both global view guidance and detail checking capability.",

   "abstract": "A novel fiber tracking algorithm (GTRACT) was developed to enhance tracking through ambiguous regions where cross fibers, fiber merging or fanning may be occurring. The software was developed using several cross platform open-source toolkits (ITK, VTK, and FLTK). The algorithm was evaluated using a freely available digital phantom dataset provided by King's College London. The results show that the GTRACT algorithm performed significantly better than standard streamline approaches and is less affected by noise.",

   "abstract": "The usage of image processing has become an important and continuous growing field in medical imaging. Although a large amount of algorithms is available, only few are routinely applied within applications for clinical diagnosis support and treatment planning. New tools are required that allow for efficient evaluation and comparison of algorithms as well as the \r\ngeneration of dedicated user interfaces with sophisticated visualization for clinical applications. We propose a generic integration of ITK algorithms into the visual programming and rapid prototyping platform MeVisLab. One of the main limitation of ITK is its lack of visualization and interaction functionality through a dedicated development platform. MeVisLab provides a modular visual programming interface with a comprehensive suite of image processing and visualization tools. The linkage of ITK algorithms to MeVisLab is based on a two step process that consists of a generic XML description for each ITK algorithm and an automatic code generator to create new MeVisLab modules, which will be made publicly available within the free version of MeVisLab. Each module can handle different image types and data dimensions dynamically at runtime. Example applications using registration, segmentation, and visualization modules are presented in order to show the capabilities of the described integration concept.",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThe authors present MITK, a freely available and truly open-source (commercial and non-commercial use) software library that provides modules that integrate and extend ITK, VTK, GLUT, and FLTK/QT. Integration alone is noteworthy - the extensions are even more noteworthy.\r\n\r\nKey features include the coordination fo multiple 2D/3D visualizations of spatial objects, a general interaction concept including undo/redo, and a layered API that hides complexity at upper levels while also allowing specialization of functionality at lower levels.\r\n\r\nThe layered approach is particularly useful in this context. A user can quickly piece together some broad modules to form a \"standard\" application, and then time can be spent to refine the inner workings of one or two of the modules to provide tailored functionality.\r\n \r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nA diversity of open-source projects can be integrated and wrapped to provide software modules that simplify medical image analysis application development.\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nThe paper is written in a casual tone and introduces the concepts behind MITK and provides a few specifcs regarding the options available in MITK.\r\n\r\nThe paper provides an excellent overview of which strengths were combined from the various open source packages that comprise MITK. That overview is written at an ideal level of detail. Specific programming constructs (e.g., smart pointers) are mentioned without going into overly detailed explanations. The details given are exactly what a reader would need to begin to investigate the integration of those packages into his/her own toolkit.\r\n\r\nThe paper, however, would benefit from a bit more details regarding what options are available to someone using MITK to develop an application. A list of available visualization models, for example. Otherwise, the authors could provide more details regarding the process of developing one or two demonstration applications using MITK. Either type of additional information would be welcome.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nMITK is released under an open-BSD-style license. It is available for commercial or non-commercial use. Many aspects are GUI independent, and GUI components from different packages (e.g., QT or FLTK) can be used; however, most work appears to be done with QT components - the development of FLTK components seems to be more limited. This is unfortunate given QT's licensing restrictions.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nThe website for MITK is very good. Publications, documentation, and the code are readily available. The installation details and requirements are well specificied.\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nMakes heavy use of open-source.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nIs released as open source: commercial and non-commercial.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nI did not look at the code, but the use of ITK, VTK, etc and the fact that the group has contributed back to those toolkits suggests that they use good coding style/practices.\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\nUsers interesting in this package should be aware of related work in the form of Slicer and SOViewers. MITK, however, appears to fill a gap between those two toolkits. It allows more specialization than Slicer, and it is easier to develop a standard application using MITK than using SOViewers.\r\n",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThis paper describes the development of a medical image software framework based on ITK, VTK, QT, and FLTK. The framework is, conceptionally, one level closer to the end-user than any of the components, because it creates high-level widgets and controls used for interacting with data and algorithms. End-user developers should be able to build interactive applications with MITK.\r\n \r\n\r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nNot Applicable\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nNot Applicable other than the fact that the framework has been built. The paper doesn't provide studies or evidence that the framework is valid, end-user acceptable, fast, or other metrics of performace. However, this was not the intent of the paper and (my opinion only) I don't believe such a study would be prudent at this time. (my opinion only) I would suggest that the software probably requires some time to mature.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nThe work is consistent with open science principles\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nThe software can be downloaded and run. Although the package hasn't been submitted with the paper, the paper explicitly describes where the code can be obtained from. I admit that I have not taken the time to download and run it. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nMost of the packages are open source except for QT which does have some licensing restrictions.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nThe whole package is available for user evaluation. In addition, the authors request community participation to test and develop the software.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nOnce again, in the intereste of full disclosure, I have not yet downloaded the package and worked with it.\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nBecause it is a framework, there are many specific applications which can utilize this code to develop targeted software.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work :</b>\r\nPerformace evaluation in the context of specifica applications.\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors :</b>\r\nIt would be beneficial to have a little code example in the text to show the implementation approach. As is noted in figure 2, a small example in fltk exists. Some amount of this code might be included and described in the text as a specific example.\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\nNone\r\n",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThis papers describes the application of algorithms available in ITK to the segmentation of brain-tumors infiltrating the skull. It also implements a methodology for evaluating their results compared to a human expert.\r\n \r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nThis paper hypothesis that segmentation methods from the Insight Toolkit can be used for delineating skull infiltrated tumors. In order to test this hypothesis, the authors selected multiple segmentation methods from the toolkit, ran segmentation on test data and implemented an evaluation methodology for comparing the results from the software-based segmentation with the human expert segmentations.\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nThe authors present abundant evidence from the result of their segmentation experiments. The comparision of the segmentation methods reveals that the authors invested a significan amount of work in exploring the applicability of the many segmentation methods compared here. It is unfortunate that the full material of those experiments was not shared with the readers, who would have derived great benefits from being able to apply the same set of experiments to other medical segmentation problems.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nThe paper describe the segmentation methods evaluated in this case, and the evaluation methodology used for comparing the results. This evaluation methodology seems to be the most valuable contribution of the paper, since it reveals that a wide set of segmentation tools were systematically tested. Unfortunately the authors did not share the source code used for their test and for their evaluation methodology. Despite the fact that their code is based on ITK filters, it would take a reader a significant amount of time to replicate the work of the authros, since the reader will have to reimplement the code for all the tests.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nThe work can hardly be reproduced. Not enough coding details are provided by the authors, and in particular, no details regarding the many numerical parameters of the segmentation methods are mentioned. In the current form it is impossible to replicate the work performed by the authors. A reader could run an equivalent set of experiments, by using ITK filters, but the lack of the input images, and the lack of details regarding the parameters will make impossible to ensure that the reader\\'s set of test is equivalent to the one reported by the authors.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nThe authors make extensive use of the Insight Toolkit, and took care of using ITK filters as building blocks. Their study of the applicability of ITK segmentation filters is certainly valuable for the readers, since it guides them towards the segmentation methods that displayed the best performance (compared to a human expert) for segmenting the skull-infiltrated tumors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nThe authors did not provide their source code.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nReviewer\\'s speculation: Judgging from the description in the paper it seems that the authors made a good use of the code available in the Insight Toolkit, by combining ITK filters as building blocks for their segmenation pipelines. \r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nThe generic problem faced by the authors is indeed quite challenging since the intensity of the image alone is not enough for segmenting the objets. The ITK methods that the authors found to be more appropriate for this problem, will probably perform well for other segmentation situations where the intensity of the object to be extracted is similar to the intensity of adjacent structures.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nMany of the methods used in VALMET (Gerig, G., Jomier, M., Chakos, M.) are now available in ITK in the form of filters. In particular the overlap measures, the Haussdorf distance and surface mean distance. It could be interesting to create a reusable framework for segmentation validation that any authors could use during the validation stages of their segmentation work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\nIt will be very useful if the authors share their source code with the community. In particular all the parameters setting of the segmentation methods. The source code of their evaluation framework will also be extremely useful for anybody performing a segmentation evaluation study.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\nSince the authors found the Chi squared value to be a convenient measure for comparing the segmentation results to the human expert delineation, it seems to be interesting to create that measure as an ITK filter.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\n\r\nAs previous reviewers have stated, this paper describes a collection of 100 diverse data sets that has been compiled already and will be made available (shortly?) for open access by the NLM via the Visible Human Project. The data sets are across species (mouse, Canine, Dophin, Mouse, Rabbit), anatomy(Abdomen, Brain, Cells, Chest, Ear, Hand, Heart, Knee, Larynx, Liver, Prostate), modality (MR, CT, Confocal Microscopy, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound, microCT, microMR), and pathology. The highest level categories of the collection are human and animal, each further subdivided into anatomical regions, then into modality, and then pathology. Many of the data sets were retrieved from archives at Mayo and collaborators, while an interesting one acquired specifcally for the collection is a full mouse data set acquired as overlapping sections with microCT and microMR at voxel resolutions of 0.02mm^3 and 0.125mm^3, and realigned into a single volume.\r\n\r\nEach data set is available in three file formats: Analyze 7.5, Analyze Volumefile, and MetaIO. References for descriptions of these formats are provided.\r\n\r\nHuman data has been anonymized and complies with HIPPA standards. \r\n\r\nThe data has been organized into a website with a custom browser.\r\n\r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nA hypotheis is that openly accessible data is useful for advancing science.\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nThis is a widely accepted truth in many fields, including biomedical research. The authors have also provided references on how exisiting collections of data such as the Visible Human and the Vanderbilt Registration data have been successfully used by many researchers in different applications.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nData sets like this are key enablers of open science. \r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nIt is not clear if the web browser and file format conversion tools are open source.\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\n\r\n- This is very useful work and should enable research in the area as the authors have noted.\r\n\r\n- For those interested in additional image collections, the authors have provided an interesting list (from open to restricted to closed): the visible Koren and Chinese human projects, MNI Brainweb for brain anatomy, UCDavis Brain atlas project for human and animal brains, BIRN brain data collection.\r\n\r\n- Following a link in the bibliography explains BIR (http://www.mayo.edu/bir)- it stands for Biomedical Imaging Resource, the group computational group at Mayo where this work was conducted. \r\n\r\n-The categories noted in the paper include 5 species, 11 anatomical regions, and 8 modalities. One can see that even if one data set was available for each bin of this table, 5x11x8x2 (the last two is one normal and one pathological) or 880 data sets would be needed. Clearly, there is room to add to this collection. Question for authors: are there guidelines that would allow other researchers to supply data sets that could be added to the collection to help populate the table? Are there NLM plans to solicit entries for this collection the way that algorithm implementations were successfully added to ITK?\r\n\r\n- Having a web based browser for the data was a great choice. As useful as downloaded data viewing applications can be, it seems that browsing data in a collection is something that is very well suited for a web based browser. I am waiting to try it out to see if the data sizes will make network lag an issue while browsing.\r\n\r\n-File formats: Is there a reason that images in this collection are not provided in the industry standard DICOM format? Most of the data in this collection seem to be the direct output of imaging scanners, does keeping it in DICOM (assuming it was once in that format) rather than converting it to the Analyze/MetaIO formats lose anything?\r\n",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b> This paper describes a new, open-access collection of medical \r\nimage data assembled by the Mayo Clinic with support from the National Library \r\nof Medicine (NLM). The collection includes over 100 datasets of\r\nvarying modalities, anatomy and subject species and is intended to support\r\nmedical imaging research. The focus of the collection is on diversity, \r\nmulti-modalilty, and new imaging modalities. A web-based interface to the \r\ncollection has been developed and the data will be made available through\r\nthe NLM.\r\n \r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nThe work was motivated by the idea that open access data collections facilitate \r\nmedical imaging research, and it follows in the footsteps of the original Visible \r\nHuman Project initiative. The authors anticipate that this data will be useful\r\nin the development and validation of new imaging algorithms.\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nThe authors clearly state their motivations behind the work and cite some evidence that \r\nsimilar efforts have been effective, but this paper is not intended to be a rigorous \r\ninvestigation into the usefulness of open access data collections.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b> This is a true open science initiative. The data is to be\r\nreleased to the research community through a web interface. The article indicates \r\nthat this is an ongoing effort.\r\n\r\nSome issues: None of the data seems to be currently available. When will it be\r\nreleased? It is also not clear from the article what restrictions will be placed \r\non the use of the data.

This data\r\nwould obviously be of great interest to the reconstruction community. It would\r\nalso be helpful to include information about the reconstruction algorithms used\r\nto produce the volumes and the scanner geometries.\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b> I would encourage the authors to include additional\r\ninformation as it becomes available, i.e. where and how to access, restrictions\r\non use, etc.\r\n\r\nSome minor points:\r\nThe article reads fairly well, but another editing pass might be useful. There are \r\nfor example, one or two typos to address (e.g. p. 3 comprhensive->comprehensive).\r\nAlso, I believe the acronym 'BIR' is never fully spelled out.\r\n\r\nI look forward to getting my hands on some of this data!\r\n\r\n",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThis paper describes a methodology for registering the successive microscopy slices of a mouse placenta using the author\\\\\\'s modified version of the ITK registration framework.\r\n \r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nThe authors suggest that the characterization of placenta morphology can be used for correlating genetic changes with phenotypic variation. The characterization of morphology is intended to be done after reconstructing a 3D model of the placenta via registration of a full microscopy sectioning of a mouse placenta.\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nThe authors provide multiple examples of the images at the various stages of the registration process, and describe many of the details of their registration approach. Unfortunately, the authors do not provide the source code used for their study, nor the images that could be used for replicating their work. \r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nThe paper do not satisfy the requirements of Open Science, since it doesnt enable the reader to repeat and replicate the work reported by the authors. The lack of source code and images makes impossible for a reader to replicate the work of the authors. However the paper provide useful advice regarding that image registration methodology that was used by the authors for performing the alignment of the microscopy images.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nThe work cannot be reproduced due to the lack of source code and images.\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nThe authors made extensive use of the Insight Toolkit, and modified some of the components in the Registration Framework, in order to suite the particular characteristics of their image registration problem. Unfortunately the source code of such modification is not being shared, so authors that are interested in using a similar approach will have to re-implement the source code for that methodology.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nSource code was not provided\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nSource code was not provided\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nThe authors introduced the interesting concept of a two level optimization scheme where the parameters of the optimizer are set differently at the beggining and at the end of the registration process. This concept seems to be applicable to many if not all of the typical image regsitration problems. It would be interesting to implement this concept into auxiliary classes and to make them available to the community as part of the Insight Toolkit.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nSince the final goal of the authors is to characterize the morphology of the surface of the placenta, it may be interesting to use registration methods that will focus on aligning the boundaries of the placenta. Among the possible options, the authors may want to consider the use of Image metrics that operate on the gradient magnitude of the images, or on the result of edge-detection algorithms such as Canny. The use of PointSet to image registration may also be appropriate for focusing the registration process on aliging the surface of the placenta.\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\nIt will be quite useful for readers if the authors share their source code and their image data.\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\nThe description of the authors reveals that they have dedicated a significant amount of time to this problem. It is unfortunate that readers involved in similar fields would have to reimplement the work reported by the authors due to the lack of source code sharing.\r\n\r\n",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThe authors have a large volume serial histology registration problem to address. Like many others, they preprocess the data and register it. The purpose of this paper is not to validate the technique (because there is not enough data or gold standards), but to describe the workflow\r\n \r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nImplicit hypothesis that there is a workflow (which happens to use ITK) that can process and register these histologic sections\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nThe authors describe the method; however, there is no code and data so there is no real evidence.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nThe authors state that they use ITK for their processing (they don't state what they use for visualization). There is no code for the two algorithms (processing and registration); however, the registration approach is the basic approach described in all of the ITK documentation. There is not much to contribute back to the open science community because it appears to be a straightforward application of the API. Possibly if the tissue detection algorithm was new, it could be plugged back into the API.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nSorry, there is no code. Equally important, there is no data. You would need both for reproducibility. Also, specific parameters for processing would have to be included as well.\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nThey used ITK\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nNope\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nWell, the area of research is important because histologic registration is really needed.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nMore validation\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\nI am pleased to see ITK being used for this type of application. It is an important area which the authors are contributing.\r\n\r\nI have several comments for the authors' consideration:\r\n\r\n(1) Your use of figure is not particularly good. Figure 1 combines two completely different thoughts into one image. Several of the figures (including the left side of Figure 3) are not specificaly referenced in the paper. They should be so a reader can go back and forth.\r\n\r\n(2) It appears that some of the pre-processing algorithm has been previously published. I appreciate the fact that your reference that while still giving some of the details. The rest probably needs validation or comparision to other methods. Also, I notice that Figure 2 suggests that you downsample the data. That is not mentioned in the text, but is really important because it has implications for the results.\r\n\r\n(3) I like the MI approach that ITK uses. I think that multiple start points is also a good ideal; however, I wouldn't call this a novel idea. It is common to have more than one registration performed with different initial conditions or perturbations.\r\n\r\n(4) For this journal (although not all journals), it is really important to have the code and data for independant validation and testing.\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\n[This is a free-form field]\r\n\r\n",

In this project we develop an easy-to-use interface that permits the same sequence of operations as described in Marc and Jones [1] and is based on Cell Kit developed by Marc's lab. Work products for this project include: user application software (Matlab), user manual and if possible, a web portal interface to allow internet access and application of the system.

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nDiscusses the on-going development of a Matlab-based tool for studying the multivariate space that describes the metabolic environment of a cell. The tool allows for the menu-based selection of different types of clustering methods (termination criterion, etc.) to explore that multivariate space.\r\n\r\nNo specific mention of open-source (use or delivery) is mentioned.\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nA prototype system is mentioned and a screenshot (without data loaded) is presented. The paper speaks mainly of work that will be accomplished in the future. The paper is extremely sparse on details. The data analysis methods mentioned are straightforward and readily developed using Matlab.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nI did some investigation on the web based on one sentence in the abstract...This work is intended to replicate and extend functionality currently available in a toolkit that was developed by the same people and that has been released as a \"pre-compiled\" IDL application. See http://prometheus.med.utah.edu/~marclab/protocols_cellkit.html It is not re-assuring that no mention of open-source is made and that previous work from this group appears to not be open-source. \r\n\r\nThe difficult balance faced by many and reflected in this work is that making freely-available software is very useful and should be applauded - however, Matlab is not freely available. Additionally, for data exploration it is often important to know the implementation details of the algorithms being applied and to be able to extend/modify those implementations.\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nThis work may be applicable to other multivariate data/cluster exploration problems - which are quite common. More details, however, are needed to determine how generic the methods and implementation will truly be.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nI look forward to future revisions of this submission to include more details in the paper, demonstration data, and the matlab source code. The scope of the problem and the solution being pursued seem like idea areas for open-source efforts to florish.\r\n",

   "abstract": "Open source technologies are increasing in popularity for software development. Many open source projects rely on skilled development teams whose members are distributed throughout the world. Often, agile development methods are employed by these teams, as the focus is on concurrent development and fast production over requirements management and quality assurance. The image-guided surgery toolkit (IGSTK) is an open source development project that relies on the collaboration of a skilled and distributed development team, yet addresses a domain that demands managing requirements as well as implementing a high degree of robustness and addressing safety concerns. Due to this unique cross-section of open source technology and the surgical domain, the IGSTK team has developed a set of best practices and requirements techniques to augment commonly applied agile methods. This paper presents the lessons we have learned as we have engaged in the software development process.",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThis paper describes the software development process for IGSTK, an open source image guided surgery toolkit whose architecture is described in a separate paper in this issue of the journal. It points out that in contrast to most open source projects, IGSTK needs to closely document the traceability of each requirement specification to its software implementation and testing in order to be compliant with the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) standards for medical devices.

Since IGSTK is still in its infancy, and its practice of capturing requirements collaboratively for traceability purposes has not yet been proven one way or another, it might be too early to knight it. \r\n-\tAs another reviewer pointed out, a trace matrix would be useful since it is a commonly used format to demonstrate traceability for FDA review. Such a three column matrix contains one row for each requirement of the project and lists (1) the requirement text (2) the sections of the code that implement it, and (3) the sections of the code that test it.\r\n-\tI think that the automatic generation of updates to requirements documents (and potentially trace matrices) is appealing for commercial medical device development, and could be a useful tool in its own right.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThis paper presents some best practices and a method for requirements capture during agile software development of the IGSTK toolkit.\r\n \r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nOne hypothesis is that requirements for a medical software toolkit can be captured during development (as they emerge).\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nNot applicable\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nThe paper adheres to the concept of open science quite well. IGSTK source code is freely available. Some of the developer documentation requires a login and password. The nightly generated requirements are also freely available on the web site. I would have liked to see the guidelines for defining requirements (for example, why is a requirement numbered REQ 06.02.13?) as well as the scripts that are used for extracting the requirements from the bug tracker. If done well, this could be as useful to the community as the IGSTK software itself (for example, CMake was developed to support ITK development and is a useful tool on its own).\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nNot really applicable. It should be possible to reproduce the requirements generation if the scripts were publically available.\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nYes, the authors use quite a bit of open source software packages (ITK, VTK, FLTK) and development tools (CMake, Dart, CVS, PHPBugTracker) and extoll their virtues appropriately.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nIGSTK is a work in process, so I have not yet tried it though I plan to use it in the future. I am not sure if I will use the requirements capture method -- that depends on how much it evolves.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nNot applicable. This paper was not about the code, but about the best practices and requirements definition.\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nThe development process identified in this paper is applicable to nearly every medical software development effort, especially if clinical use is anticipated.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nThe problem of capturing requirements and maintaining traceability (and consistency) between requirements, software implementation and testing is of critical importance. The current solution of using the bug tracker is a good start, but much more could be done. The nightly-generated requirements document is just a sorted list (based on the requirement number, which is somehow assigned by the programmer) and is not as easy to read as a typical manually-created requirements document. In my opinion, it would be nice to have a hyperlinked traceability matrix in which you can easily navigate between requirement, source code implementation, test procedure and test result.\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\nI would like more information about the way in which the requirements are numbered.\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\nI am an advisor to this project and am listed in the Acknowledgments.\r\n\r\n",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThis article presents a very interesting toolkit used for cortical grey thickness measurement. The paper gives a very thorough description of the the open source software, TINA, but gives almost no information on the thickness measurement itself. After reading the referenced technical report, thickness is measured by shooting rays normal to the GM/WM boundary and carefully measuring their lengths.\r\n\r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nThickness is measured as the length of a straight line connecting the GM/WM surface to the GM/CSF surface.\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nThe method is validated as follows. The authors made thickness measurement in 13 young adults and compared their results to the ones of Kabanis et al. made on 20 young adults on a different data set. This form of validation is questionable, but due to the lack of a true gold standard for cortical thickenss measurements it is already quite an achievement that the method is validated.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science and Reproducibility:</b>\r\nSource code is provided as well as user's and developper's guides. The data is not shared.\r\nI have not tried to reproduce the results and even if I tried and I had the data, I would probably need some training to be able to run the software. Also I did not see any description of the parameters used.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nThe entire TINA toolkit is open source and it offers a nice alternative to other toolkits.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nFrom what I browsed on the doxygen pages, the code is nicely written. The main point of discussion is the programing language used for the toolkit (C). Even though I am theoretically inclined to believe C++ offers much greater flexibility for software development, my experience with ITK and its highly templated code is not painless. It would be interesting to see how fast developemnt can be made by both novice and expert programmers in these two very different coding philosophies.\r\n \r\n\r\n",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nAn open-source, view-based (i.e., 2D) image processing system. Ultimate focus is medical image analysis, but also includes routines useful to computer vision (camera geometry, stereo matching).\r\n\r\nWritten in C with some platform specific code for UNIX/Linux/Cygwin. \r\n\r\nThe system was largely developed within one group and is perhaps limited in functionality. It is not appropriate for 3D medical image analysis application development and contains a limited number of methods for 2D image analysis.\r\n\r\nMost of the information below was gathered from the TINA website, not from the paper. The TINA website is excellent, but it revealed the limitations of the system that weren't specifically mentioned in the paper. The TINA website is http://tina-vision.net The website appears very up-to-date - with many papers from 2005. Perhaps, however, the paper is discussing a verision of TINA that supports 3D image analysis and more functions. If so, I apologize for my mistake, and I look forward to clarification from the authors.\r\n\r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nThe authors propose that TINA is an effective tool for medical image analysis. In particular, it is useful for cortical thickness estimation.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nExploring the TINA website suggests that TINA has limited capabilities for representing images and for providing methods that work on multiple types of images. Most notable, (1) a TINA image is a C record that uses a (void *) variable to support different pixel types, (2) it only supports 2D images, and (3) special functions must be written to access vector pixel types.\r\n\r\nRegarding, image processing, TINA appears to only provide a small set of methods. Consider, for example, that the following \"Noise Filters\" are currently available (the following is the documentation from their website):\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nThe following routines can be used for the removal of various forms of noise and unwanted data variation from images.\r\n\r\nImrect *im_bthresh(double k,Imrect *im)\r\n\r\nReturns an image which is a binary thresholded version of the input image around the value defined by 6#6.\r\n\r\nImrect *im_thresh(double k,Imrect *im)\r\n\r\nReturns an image which has been thresholded to set all pixel values below 6#6 to zero. This is useful, for example, in the elimination of unwanted terms in the 2D Fourier domain of an image.\r\n\r\nImrect *im_corrupt(Imrect * im, int dx, int dy, double a, double b)\r\n\r\nGenerate an image by adding uniform random noise (generated by imf_unif_noise(im->width, im->height, dx, dy, a, b)) to the input image. Useful in the generation of simulated test data for the evaluation of algorithm stability.\r\n\r\nImrect *im_rank(Imrect *im, int range, double noise)\r\n\r\nReturns an image with each pixel (of measurement accuracy 11#11 ) given by the rank of its value in the surrounding 12#12 x 12#12 patch. Useful for enhancing the spatial information content of an image before the process of cross correlation or template matching.\r\n\r\nImrect *im_median(Imrect *im)\r\n\r\nReturns a median filtered (discontinuity preserving) version of the input image (each pixel replaced by the median value of the 3x3 neighbourhood). Useful for the removal of sensor or aliasing derived pixel dropout. This technique should only be used when there is no alternative, generally it is better to eliminate the problem at source).\r\n\r\nImrect *im_tsmooth(Imrect * im1)\r\n\r\nReturns an image which has been smoothed by averaging in a direction tangential to the image gradient at each point (discontinuity preserving).\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nRegarding the specific application for cortical thickness estimation, it is interesting that their volume estimation analysis must have been conducted by processing the slices individually and not as a 3D segmentation task. It would be interesting to compare those estimates with estimates made when 3D smoothing and other 3D neighborhood information is considered.\r\n\r\nIn summary, their work is extremely well presented in this paper and in the many other papers presented on their website. Their work is also extremely important and beneficial - clinically and to the image analysis community. This software package, however, is perhaps a bit limited in scope.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nThe authors and the TINA project have made use of and contributed to open-source. Their system integrates with R and promotes other open-source packages (gnuplot, etc.). They are also making many of their datasets available online.\r\n\r\nHowever, their software product, TINA, is not the most up-to-date image analysis software package available. Users should consider VXL, ITK, MITK, MeVisLab or other pacakges that are more easily extended to other medical image analysis tasks.\r\n\r\n",

The goal of the project is to make both source and data available. Currently sources are available but data (for the discussed application at least) is not.\r\n\r\n<b> Open Source/Reproducibility </b>\r\n\r\nThe package is open source -- sources and documentation are available on www.tina-vision.net. It is written in C (GUI in GDK/GTK, Motif) and primarily targets GNU/Linux platforms. It reportedly also compiles on MacOSX and Solaris and instructions are provided on the website for how to run it on a Windows machine using a version of linux that can run off a flash/CD drive without installing any files on the hard drive. I was able to build it under Cygwin in Windows XP (see notes below) and launched a couple of the programs mentioned in the documentation (mri_analysis and example2). \r\n\r\n<b> Open Science/Reproducibility </b>\r\nI did not find either the data used by the authors in the cortical thickness measurement experiment, or documentation on which program I should invoke to compute the measures if I wanted to try it out on my own data. \r\n\r\n<b> Other Comments </b>\r\n-\tI would recommend the README file that is distributed with the source to anyone who wants to learn more about this software. It is a very well written document both for history of the project as well as structure/compilation of the sources. Had I not been compiling in a non-certified environment, I expect the build would have been quite straightforward with the use of this file.\r\n-\tBased on the description of the toolkit, the user interfaces of the provided examples, as well as the documentation on the website, this package seems to be more targeted towards computer vision researchers who might be interested in duplicating/building upon the results created using TINA, rather than for clinical user who would like to, for example, meaure the cortical thickness in their own MR data.\r\n-\tNotes for compiling in Cygwin/Windows XP: 1)commented out AC_MINGW32 in tina-libs/configure.ac and tina-tools/configure.ac, 2) created links from cygwin libtool binary in tina-libs and tina-tools (and renamed the libtool created there),3) reinstalled x11-bin and gtk packages in cygwin. Notes for running the examples: 1)I needed to copy various cygwin dlls from their usual locations (/bin and /usr/X11R6/bin) to the directory from which I launched the examples, even though the PATH environment variable contained these locations 2)run startxwin.bat to start an x server and then ran the examples in tina-tools/toolkits/mri_analysis(example, example2)/tinaTool.exe.\r\n",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThe authors propose a (uniform?) map-distortion approach to getting crisp anatomy diagrams for MRI images of an organ whose positional variability with respect to tissue class information is aparently unknown to them. The basal ganglia and perhaps the cerebellum could well be solved this way, but not the cerebral cortex.\r\n \r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nThe authors propose the (novel?) hypothesis that tissue segmentation should be contingent on the deformability of a tissue-type probability vector atlas onto the acquisition structural image set; that bias field correction should be iterative and anatomy-based; that a stochastic approach to what sampling of features to use will lead to a convergent labeling of the image set with stable posterior class likelihood images; and that the MRI signal from adjacent voxels constitutes the right pool from which to draw feature samples. In this, the authors' interest in texture-driven \"surface reconstruction\" reported elsewhere appears to be what they have in mind (conjecture).\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nThey claim to be evaluating tissue classifications with a \"synthetic data ground truth\" phantom image generation process, but didn't validate the appropriateness of their phantom, either. We didn't even find out if the phantom was based on an MRI scan that classified well.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nThere were no Open Science software submissions with this work-in-progress report.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nThe only way to reproduce the work corresponding to this report is to steal their idea and crank out code of our own. However, I already know that prior probability field deformation and bias field estimation are inadequate to solve the problem of classifying the human cerebral cortex volume as to gyri and sulci and as to gray matter wrapped around positionally variable white matter spines.\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nThe authors dutifully cited their use of ITK, but seemed to miss the point of what someone with experience in brain imaging and already using ITK would want in the way of significant details: knowing that pixel features are stored in an Image class instantiated with a PixelType of [type] Vector is hardly news; instead (in addition?) there should be a discussion of how the kernel size varies from early iterations to late ones: does it go from gross to fine on a schedule? What kind of signal processing filter does this in effect establish, and how does it compare to, say, an edge-preserving filter like itkGradientAnisotropicDiffusionImageFilter?\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nThey provided a flow chart, and said such a scheme is open to user experimentation, but their code has not been released into ITK yet.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nWe are left to expect they are planning to meet the ITK consortium standards for things added to ITK.\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nThe Parzen method, sorting out worthwhile signal from characterizable error, is general, and suggests considerations of interest to anyone coping with numerically founded map or diagram fitting.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nStatistical texture is a part of choosing the training classes in the stereotaxic cluster Mahalanobis metric classifier I contributed[1] to brains2, but we found that it was important to have the same prior probabilities for classes everywhere throughout the image. We currently have split bias field correction out as a pre-processing stage (that uses ITK) for our T1-T2 tissue classification workup.\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\nThe authors propose an implausible kind of measurement feedback based on stability of its outcome. Someone needs to make the case somewhere that MRI tissue classification is a discrete-outcome maximum likelihood kind of probability estimate, rather than a voxel composition fractions kind of probability estimate as histology would suggest.\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\nBrain tissue classification is an important problem, but one that must be distinguished from the more anatomically positional problem of parcellation into the functioning units of the cerebral cortex and its supporting nuclei. An atlas has no business decreeing whether you may see gray matter at each of the anatomical coordinates you have imaged. \r\n\r\n[1] Harris, G., Andreasen, N.C.,Cizadlo, T., Bailey, J.M., Bockholt, H.J., Magnotta, V.A., and Arndt, S. 1999.

   "abstract": "In this paper , we propose an extension to the National Library of Medicine's Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK. www.itk.org) with a companion image access and archival system that merges the image transfer capabilities of DICOM with DSpace (www.dspace.org), an open-source web-based digital library technology. We have extended and linked existing, freely-available DICOM and digital library software to create DICOM Accessible Digital Libraries (DADLs). Specifically, DICOM objects (and other medical image data formats such at Analyze,MetaImage) uploaded to a DADL can be grouped with other files such as journal articles or tracker data, viewed as thumbnails, and made publicly or privately available for others to search and download from a linked DICOM server. In that manner, once a researcher has identified the data he / she needs via an Internet search using meaningful descriptors, the data can be directly downloaded via standard DICOM query and retrieve utilities and that data will be perpetually indexed and accessible via an Internet handle.",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThis paper presents a tool for sharing DICOM images by using the Open Source systems DSpace and DCMTK.\r\n\r\n \r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nThis paper parts from the hypothesis that a DICOM query retrieve system based on Open Source tools, can be develop for empowering users to share DICOM images.\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nA System was developed using DSpace (an open source system for maintaining institutional repositories) and DCMTK a DICOM library. The system is used for managing the images of this current conference, which provides clear evidence for its usability. \r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nThe paper fully adheres to the principles of Open Science. The full material used and developed by the authors is made available. The source code of the DICOM tools is made available as part of Insight Applications, a DICOM image example is provided in order to test the system, and even the Latex source file of the paper has been uplodaded and shared with the readers.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nThe reviewer attempted to rebuild the software but got entangled in a number of issues.\r\n1) This applicationrequires the dcmtk library to be built into the same system\r\n2) A number of modifications were needed in order to configure the system with CMake 2.2\r\n3) The library \"libwrap\" should be installed in the system. This seems to be needed for SSH access.\r\n\r\nAfter this modification, the reviewer still end up in a link error problem that didn't seem to be trivial to solve since it was a missing symbol from the dcmtk library.\r\n\r\nThe reviewer did this with a Debian Linux system, so it seems that some work is required for enhancing the portability of the application.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nThe authors made extensive use of open source tools. In particular\r\n\r\n* dcmtk : DICOM library\r\n* ITK : Image processing\r\n* FLTK : Graphical user interface\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nThe author have contributed their code already to the Insight Toolkit and it is distributed as part of InsightApplications. Unfortunately the code is not build at this point in all the platforms that are tested in the Dashboard, because it requires dcmtk to be build in the same system. It is worth to make an effort to ensure that this applications gets built nightly in at least the most popular platforms.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nThe code is well structured and follows the coding style of the Insight Toolkit.\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nThe tool can be reused by converting it into a module of larger applications. It is worth to add an extra GUI designed to be embedded into a main FLTK window, so the entire current application could be the PACS communication module of a larger application.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nDetaching the application from the GUI may be an interesting thing to pursue. Probably something that should be done by a third party to ensure that the central piece of the query / retrieve functionalities can be used from different GUI fronts.\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\nAdditional instructions on how to build the application will be appreciated. In particular on how to build dcmtk so that it is compatible with the configuration of the application.\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\nFuture authors submitting papers to the Insight Journal may want to use this appliation as a portal for reusing data that has already been contributed to the image database of the journal.\r\n\r\n",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThis paper describes the combination of the DICOM tools available within ITK (or more specifically, the DCMTK tools) with the DSpace package. The purpose of this work is to create an open, accessible framework for archiving medical image data. \r\n\r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nThis work is not specifically hypothesis driven; however, the underlying supposition of this work is that there is a need for a well-defined architecture that for medical image archiving outside the scope of clinical RIS, HIS, and PACS systems\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nThe evidence will be generated as the package is used. Given that the submission system for this journal appears to be based on DSpace and the CADDLab MIDAS, I think that this evidence is already being generated. \r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nThis work is consistent with open science principles.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nUnfortunately, I have to say this is the only area where the paper is missing information. I would not be able to reproduce this very easily because the necessary information is not available. It would be beneficial to have an additional documented with this submission which lays out the steps required to link DSpace and DCMTK into a working system.\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nThis project takes full advantage of open-source software to achieve the goals. \r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nThe extensions proposed and effort in linking the different packages should add to the open source movement.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nNot Applicable\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nThis described tool/framework has broad applicability to many different image database collections.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work :</b>\r\nCollaborate with everybody.\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors :</b>\r\n\r\nHere are a few suggestions/thoughts \u00e2\u0080\u0093\r\n\r\nIn paragraph 1, you could have better referenced your references. I noted that the DSpace reference was missing right away. Also, in paragraph 1, you refer to the NIH data sharing policy. I suggest that you look for a specific reference about that or suggest that this is your interpretation of what NIH might be interested in.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner, in paragraph 3, it would be appropriate to include a reference for the Library of Congeress\u00e2\u0080\u0099 web-based handle system.\r\n\r\nIn section 2.1 you should consider a reference for proper anonymization or a description of what you information you anonymize. \r\n\r\nI would suggest a simple readme.txt that outlines the necessary steps to create a DADL.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\n\r\nThere is no reason that this work shouldn't receive a higher score except there is little information on the creation of a DADL using the work that the authors have done. While most of my suggestions aren't particularly important, I would stress the addition of a readme file for setup. This would not require much effort by the authors, but would dramatically increase the rating.",

The key goal of the toolkit is to provide \u00e2\u0080\u009csafety-by-design\u00e2\u0080\u009d, thus to ensure (or support) robustness of image-guided surgery applications by means of adhering to the toolkits design specifications. A key concept (also mentioned in the paper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s title) to achieve this goal is the use of state machines.\r\n \r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nOnly partially applicable: An implicit hypothesis of the paper is that safety-by-design is possible and state machines are suitable to achieve safety-by-design.\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nOnly partially applicable: Evidence for the hypothesis can not be expected until the toolkit has been used for real-life image-guided surgery scenarios.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nA real open science project, everything is publicly available via the web-addresses mentioned in the article.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nI did download, compile and run the code, but not recently (several months ago).

It is explicitly stated that only a very restrictive API is being provided to ensure as high a safety level as possible.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nPersonal opinion: I like the idea of using explicit state machines (not surprisingly, as we use them also in MITK, although with a different focus). I would be interested in how much they support the \u00e2\u0080\u009csafety-by-design\u00e2\u0080\u009d goal, thus would be looking forward to a paper addressing this issue.

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThis submission is a software toolkit for building Image-Guided Surgery (IGS) applications, and the companion paper describes the state machine abstraction used in the design of the toolkit. The toolkit is written in C++ and builds upon other three other open source toolkits, ITK (for image representation and processing), VTK (for visualization), and FLTK (for user interface). \r\n\r\nThis review consisted of using the instructions in the paper to download the sources and compile the toolkit (under Cygwin on a Windows XP on a Sony Viao S260 laptop with Intel 1.7Gz/512 MB Ram), running the examples, reading technical discussions that have been captured on the IGSTK wiki, joining the mailing list and participating in discussions there, and examining the source code. \r\n\r\n<b> Significance </b>\r\nI think that the creation of IGSTK is very timely. Unlike the scenario of 5-10years ago, when the technology involved in building IGS platforms was novel enough that various research labs created in-house prototypes and used those to perform scientific research, the IGS landscape today is much more mature with several companies building systems and over a thousand hospitals using these commercial systems on a routine basis. This migration of IGS systems into the commercial domain has created somewhat of a logistical void between the research and commercial worlds; Building the software and hardware for such systems from scratch no longer belongs in the research domain but at the same time companies in the area have not yet published interfaces that would allow researchers to easily test their applications/algorithms in a clinical context. I expect IGSTK to be most relevant for researchers who are seeking a software platform on which to add their contributions (such as improvements to the accuracy of a registration algorithm, a novel segmentation algorithm, a novel clinical workflow etc.) without first having to build the platform. \r\n\r\n<b> Hypothesis </b>\r\nI would say that there are three underlying hypotheses in this work: (1) a toolkit is needed for IGS (b) open source is a good way to do it and (c) state machines are a good abstraction for the components of such a toolkit.\r\n\r\n<b> Evidence </b>\r\nOn need and open source: I think that there is general agreement in the field that such a toolkit would be useful and that it's existence could allow researchers to focus on creating novel algorithms and clinical applications. The benefits of open source are well known and hence the argument for an open source version of the toolkit, but I can also see another scenario (with its own overhead, no doubt) that would achieve similar impact in which established IGS companies would provide APIs that would allow researchers to add applications to their existing hardware and software platforms. In fact, IGS companies have considered this options for a while and perhaps the existence of IGSTK will accelerate that process and allow researchers to have multiple options. The benefit of the API would be the availability of both the hardware and the software, while the benefit of the open source software toolkit is that one doesn't need to deal with any commercial entities.\r\n\r\nOn State Machines: The major components of the toolkit (viewers, spatial objects, tracker, logger) are modeled explicitly as state machines with well defined states and transitions. I think that the tracker component is particularly well suited to this abstraction because it models a device with a few clearly defined states and transitions. The use of the abstraction made the code of the tracker classes very simple to follow. I couldn't see the immediate benefit (or hazard) of using the same abstraction for the other components, for which I have seen non state-machine based implementations that do the job just fine. In any case, the motivation for using state machines is to potentially facilitate comprehensive testing, which is a good thing. For the interested reader, an active discussion is ongoing in the group via the mailing list and the wiki pages about how best to utilize hierarchical state machines in the toolkit.\r\n\r\n<b> Misc Points on Open Source/Useability/Code/Practices for Potential Users </b>\r\n- http://www.igstk.org is the best place to get the latest information about the toolkit. and is actively updated.\r\n- Good engineering practices (revision control, nightly builds, error monitoring via dashboards, active mailing lists, reasonable coding style,code reviews, documentation, wiki discussions) are all followed in the project which means that if you start using this toolkit, you will inherit a community that will answer your questions at the very least, and probably also help you move forward in your work.\r\n-Even if you are not interested in using the entire toolkit, some of the components such as the Tracker and the SpatialObjects can be used independently. The tracker component allows easy intergration of different trackers (NDI trackers are currently supported) and also has a very useful simulation mode to allow testing/demo without a physical tracker.\r\n-The learning curve for users who are not familiar with the VTK and ITK worlds will be steep. For example, I don't use cmake in my daily life, so I always spend the bulk of my installation cycles reminding myself on how to use it.\r\n-Some installation notes: I started with the iteration-2 tag, but quickly moved to the cvs head to take advantage of the additional bug fixes and features. If you are using Tortoise on Windows to interface to cvs (like I do), ensure that the tags are set correctly when you decide to move from the iteration-# tag to the head. I also had to comment out a line in the file igstkImageSpatialObjectRepresentation.cxx (line 170 in v1.1. of the file) to be able to compile. I figured I'd revisit it if I was missing any functionality in the examples, but didn't seem to.\r\n-The developer mailing list is quite active and the IGSTK team is very responsive to outside questions/input. If you are considering using this toolkit down the road, you might find it beneficial to get involved with the group now and share your use-cases with them. \r\n- The tool is a work in progress, as are the example programs available with it. The team plans to release a clinically realistic application example this year, which should showcase more of its functionality.\r\n\r\n<b> Overall </b>\r\nI am giving this paper a 4 rating because it satisfies all the criteria of good open source in terms of mechanics, and I also think that the end result will be useful to the field and the current state of the work shows every indication that it will get there within the year. For folks who are interested in checking it out right now, my suggestion is that the time you will spend getting a working copy of the toolkit on your machine will be worthile if you are a developer and would like to be an informed participant in the discussions that are shaping the toolkit. If your interest is to use the toolkit to build your own application, I would recommend waiting until the first clinical tracking application is released later this year.\r\n\r\n",

   "abstract": "Mathematical models are often used to describe natural phenomena, organisms and anatomy. This paper presents a Model-Image Registration framework that can be used to evaluate models of anatomical shape. An optimisation process is applied to the model parameters to fit the model to an organ of interest in a volumetric image. The fit is obtained by maximising a metric that measures how closely the model surface atches the image edge features, according to gradient magnitude and orientation with respect to the surface normal. The system was tested using a spiral shell model, with generated data as ground truth, and also with CT scans of the temporal bone. The parameters converge to within a close tolerance after a few hundred iterations on the test data, and show promising results on registering with the clinical data.",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nDescribes an toolkit for generating meshes for MR volumes. Summarizes the software architecture, illustrates results, and provides experimental results from comparison with a commercial package.\r\n\r\nThe documentation provided with the code states that the software is for non-commecial-use only. I wish the authors had stated that in their paper. I also wish they would clarify if this includes its use in grant funded research which has been ruled to be a commecial use by the courts. This limited licensing dampens my enthusiam for the software.\r\n\r\nMy main focus during this review has been the installation of the software. My initial experiences are given next.\r\n\r\n<b>Installation Notes:</b>\r\nI attempted to download and install this package.\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li> It requires the installation of subversion to access the package </li>\r\n<li> The package requires three other software packages. The authors did not provide links to those packages in the documentation distributed with the code.\r\n<ol> \r\n <li> http://www.lam-mpi.org/ A message passing interface for parallel computation - does not use cmake </li>\r\n <li> http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-as/download/index.html This software also requires the installation of Python and the rebase modules for Cygwin. </li>\r\n <li> VTK is also required - but this is not mentioned in the paper or in the documentation provided with the code - uses cmake </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<li> The MPI license is open source - YEAH!\r\n<li> The PETsc license requires special compilation options to turn off GNU licensed code that otherwise restricts the binary redistribution and use of the code. See: http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-as/documentation/copyright.html\r\n<li> My laptop ran out of disk space when installing python and rebase on cygwin </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nOverall, the software seems to be simple to install, but the process is more complex and time consuming than the authors imply in their paper. The use of other open source packages is applauded, but in this case, the mix of technologies used by those packages confounds the installation process. \r\n\r\nThe reality is, however, that there are few, if any, alternative solutions to the problems being addressed by this package. It is an important contribution to the field. Its burden is light relative to the potential benefits.\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nThe paper provides illustrative and experimental results.\r\n\r\nThe illustrative results are clearly presented.\r\n\r\nThe experiment results are convincing. The authors compared their method with a commercial system. The commercial system was deemed the gold standard. Their system produced a mean Hausdorff distances of ~2mm and a max distance of ~7mm compared to the commercial system. These measures were calculated using MR data from three neurosurgical patients. The time required for mesh generation is 5 minutes for pre-processing and 10-25 seconds for mesh generation.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nThe code is a mix of open and limited-open source. The main code is limited to non-commercial use. The secondary packages require the specification of compilation options to eliminate code with GNU licensing restrictions. It is unclear what impact the use of the alternative code will have on the performance of the system.\r\n\r\nThe data used in the experiments are not publicly available, but some testing data is provided with the code.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nI am fairly confident that I could reproduce the results stated.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Software:</b>\r\nThe system is not completely open-source - it is not available for commecial use - it is unclear if it can be used for grant funded research.\r\n\r\nThe packages used are open-source, but they have very different installation needs. This complicates the installation process.\r\n\r\nThe intended application is intra-operative processing for surgical guidance. Therefore a parallel implementation is being pursued. However, for more general use, it would be nice if requirement for an MPI library could be turned-off as a cmake option.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nThe installation code has holes as noted above.\r\n\r\nMost of the source code is very well documented. Doxygen comments are very good in most files. The ITK coding style is followed in most files.\r\n\r\nCertain files (e.g., tetra_mesh.h) appear to be converted C code. They do not use doxygen comment style or ITK coding style.\r\n\r\nThe authors' intent is to integrate this code with ITK. The non-conforming files would need to be updated prior to such integration.\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nThe algorithms is much needed by the field and broadly applicable. I look forward to the refinement of the code and the installation process.\r\n\r\n",

The paper is clearly presented and illustrated with renderings and statistics.\r\nWhat is the justification of the resampling? Does this impact the quality of the results?\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nCould the authors provide the data they used (case #1, case #2, and case #3)?\r\nOther data are provided, but having the exact same data would make possible the reproduction of the results and the comparison with future methods.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nI did not reproduce the authors results since I did not install all the required packages (for example PETSc).\r\nI believe that it is possible to reproduce the results shown in the paper when all the packages are installed and the same data is available.\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nThe authors use other Open Source packages. Dependence on MPI, PETSc and Shewchuk\\'s code could be painful for installation and maintenance.\r\nDo the authors plan to remove those dependencies? or provide a CMakeLists.txt that would simplify the build?\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nThe authors provide all their source code in a clean directory structure. Thanks! :-)\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nThe code looks very good and is easy to read. I did not check if the code compiles on different platforms.\r\nCould the authors comment on that?\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nI believe that this implementation could be very useful to many applications in Medical Imaging and other disciplines.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nI would be interested to see the application of this very valuable implementation to more sophisticated geometries and to the surgery of highly deformable anatomical structures.\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\nThe results section is very clear. Additionally I would suggest the comparison of this method with the method of Alliez et al., Variational Tetrahedral Meshing, 2005.\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\nThe URL might have changed since the first publication of this paper.

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThis paper describes BioImage Suite, a collection of GUI driven medical image analysis applications as well as command line tools and support for batch processing. The applications are all created from a common set of underlying modules and have similar look and feel. This suite of applications is in use in various labs at Yale, and the authors expect that it will be publicly available by the end of 2005. The paper provides a listing of the algorithms and applications in the package (on pages 2 and 3) and the takeaway is that most major areas of medical image analysis research is covered in some form in this suite (bias correction for segmentation, deformable registration, fmri activation detection/roi analysis, diffusion image analysis, shape based cardiac deformation are some examples). An interesting feature that is unique to BioImage Suite is that it has an interface to a commercial Image-Guided Surgery System (Brainlab).\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science/Reproducibility/Open Source Contributions/Code Quality</b>\r\nThis work does not currently contribute much to open science/source since the programs (either executables or source) are not available at this time. However, the authors intend to make the software publicly accessisble by the end of the year. If I understand the intended licensing plan correct, it is to (a) make all algorithm implementations available under GPL and (b) to make all GUI-based applications available under a dual license (like mySQL) in which a GPL license is available to those who intend to keep the modified source code open, and a commercial license to those who intend to restrict access to the source.\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nThe authors report using VTK/ITK/TCL/TK.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\n- My recommendation to the authors would be to try to pick the brains of a research group that has recently converted their in-house tools (and licenses) to an open source model.\r\n- A few typos in the paper: search for \"BuiImage suite includes a clean\" and remove the \"is included in BioImage Suite\" from the end of the sentence. Search for \"The later also\" and replace with \"The latter also\". In the Graphical Applications section: the numbering of tools starts with (v) at the fmriTool - add numbers to the ones listed earlier in the section. Search for \"the SPECT processing toll written by\" and add \"(b)\" in front of it. Search for \" the PET processing package developed\" and add \"(c)\" in front of it. Search for \"will be release using the\" and replace with \"will be released using the\".\r\n\r\n<b> Other Comments </b>\r\n\r\n- The interface to the Brainlab Image-Guided Surgery system is a unique attribute of this package. I believe that such interfaces will allow easier transition of cutting edge algorithms/applications from research labs to widely used IGS systems. This work, combined with the IGSTK toolkit for image-guided surgery (also an entry in this journal issue), are all steps in the right direction for the field of image-guided surgery.",

Lately, through a joint effort between the Sim Group at CIMIT and the Alcove group at INRIA, we have investigated the foundations for a more extensive, flexible, and comprehensive framework. In addition, five internationally renowned research groups have contributed to this initiative by converting their algorithms into compatible modules. Although still in its very early developmental phase, the current project illustrates some of the key concepts we believe will enable collaboration and interoperability in Medical Simulation. The main objective of SOFA research is to foster collaboration among research groups. It is our hope that SOFA will simplify the development cycles, reduce production costs, and provide a means to share components through a common interface.",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThe paper lays out software and framework considerations for a multi-site approach to medical simulation, including issues such as collision detection. The approach described as based on mapping and multi-representation, so that different computational and physical aspects of interacting objects can be communicated. The details of how the system actually works are very sparse, however.\r\n\r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nNon Applicable\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nThe substantial lack of references/citations hinders the evaluation of this work, because it makes it difficult to asses the novelty of the framework presented. The Introduction, in particular, lacked references to any other work in medical simulation or its computational components. The discussion of collision detection did not reference any of the large computer graphics literature on the subject (for example, a variety of datastructures have evolved to support efficient evaluation of collision detection). The actual evidence in the paper, such as it was, was in the form of Section 3 (\\\"Proof of concept\\\"), which is more in outline form than a textual exposition. The details are sufficiently sparse that it is hard to know how rudimentary a system created Figures 2 and 3.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nUnfortunately there are few if any specific contributions to Open Science in this paper, although it may well be that when released the \\\"Open Framework\\\" described will be a significant contribution. As this paper is essentially a report about an proof-of-concept (and unreleased) implemenetation.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nUnfortunately there is no means of Reproducibility here because there was no code release and no instructions on how to regenerate results. \r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nThere is a distinct lack of detail in this respect. It is not clear from the paper what software generated Figures 2 and 3, for example, and whether it is Open Source. In general, the paper describes an \\\"Open Framework\\\", but the text of the paper does not describe if the software developed the framework will all be open source. Reference 4 mentions \\\"open source\\\", but it is not clear what role that software plays in the work described. \r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nNo code was made availble. There is mention of something being done for Medicine Meets Virtual Reality 2006, but there is no code release associated with whatever generated Figures 2 and 3.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nNo code was made available for this paper, or was any described in sufficient detail to answer this point. Issues of language choice, platform specificity, performance, and testing, are not addressed.\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nGeneral computational frameworks for this sort of problem would be a useful back-end for any number of medical imaging efforts. At the current level of detail, it hard to suggest specific connections to other problems or efforts.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nI look forward to seeing a more fleshed-out version of the work described in Section 3!\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\nNo specific information is needed from the authors. As noted above, the paper is lacking references and implementation specifics.\r\n\r\n",

This simulation is done at the organ level by generating geometrical models and providing support for collision detection functionalities, as well as simulating physical properties of biological tissues.

The work seems to be currently at the design and prototyping stages.\r\n \r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nThe paper advances the hypothesis that anatomical some physical aspects of anatomical organs can be simulated in software with enough accuracy for being used in medical applications such as training.\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nThe paper does not provide evidence to support the hypothesis. Instead it describes the design rationale of the framework, and provides an overview of the functionalities that will be implemented.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nThe paper does not adhere to the practice of open science, since readers are not given the elements that will allow them to verify the claims made on the paper.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nThe paper do not enable reproducibility since it is centered in describing a set of design criteria and a set of software requirements.\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nThe authors do not explicity specify whether the final simulation framework will be made open source.\r\nThe reviewer speculates that this is the case, but still remains to be seen what licensing mechanism is selected by the developers of the framework.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nThe authors do not provide source code, and it is not clear if they will do it in the future, once the framework is implemented.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nCode quality could not be assesed due to the lack of source code availability.\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nThe reviewer considers that a medical simulation tool will have a large set of application, but given that there are similar ongoing efforts it is unclear why users will prefer this framework to other medical simulation software.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nIf the authors are interested in making their software available, the reviewer suggest that they consider the approach of \\\"release early, release often\\\".\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\nThe reviewer will appreciate if the authors can clarify their use of open source tools, and their intention on the final distribution of their software.\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\n\r\nThis paper presents a statistical approach to segmenting MRI brain scans. It extends a method described by Teo et al. It is an implementation of a K-means classifier.\r\n\r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\n\r\nThe first stated assumption is that \"the value of each voxel intensity in a given class can be considered as a random variable, independent across pixels\". The second assumption is that the voxel intensities are normally distributed. The hypothesis of the paper is that <i>a priori</i> intensity statistics can be derived from an image which can then be used to segment the tissue types.\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\n\r\nThe authors present segmentation results on two different MRI data sets. These results could not be reproduced, as the data and parameters were not provided.\r\n\r\nThe data used for validation was first from coronal MRI scans. The data was hand-segmented and compared with the classified output of the program. The correspondence in all 10 cases was very good (>0.7). The second test involved a single ROI from an MRI of the prefrontal cortex. The correspondence with manual segmentation was similarly high.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\n\r\nThe paper includes full source, but no data or parameters.\r\n\r\nThe full details of the algorithm are not included in this paper, apparently due to space constraints. This makes it difficult to evaluate the algorithm, verify the claims and implementation.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\n\r\nNo data was provided to reproduce the findings in the paper. At least one data set and accompanying parameters should be supplied, in order to enable people to reproduce the results.\r\n\r\nI downloaded, compiled and ran the program. It was built on a Debian GNU/Linux Pentium 4 system with GCC 3.3 and ITK CVS.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any test data, I obtained a data set from BrainWeb (http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/brainweb/). The dataset selected was Modality=T1, Protocol=ICBM, Phantom_name=normal, Slice_thickness=1mm, Noise=3%, INU=20%. Since the implementation works in 2D, I selected slice 87 for testing (being close to those shown in the paper, with bone, white matter, grey matter, and CSF - bone was note removed as mentioned in the paper). The histogram of this slice reveals 4 peaks (at approx 3.5, 42.1, 99.0, 133.2) representing the four classes mentioned above.\r\n\r\nThe program was run, specifying 2 filter passes and 4 classes. The output is shown below:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\ncluster[0]-- \r\n estimated mean : 4.70918\r\n estimated covariance : 27.4318\r\ncluster[1]-- \r\n estimated mean : 46.2727\r\n estimated covariance : 136.147\r\ncluster[2]-- \r\n estimated mean : 97.0753\r\n estimated covariance : 98.3453\r\ncluster[3]-- \r\n estimated mean : 133.666\r\n estimated covariance : 103.385\r\nPrior image in initial section [0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25]\r\nRawData image in initial section 0\r\nData image in initial section [1.79769e+308, 1.79769e+308, 1.79769e+308, 1.79769e+308]\r\nInitial Posteriors [4.49423e+307, 4.49423e+307, 4.49423e+307, 4.49423e+307]\r\nAfter renormalizing in initial section [0, 0, 0, 0]\r\nPosteriors after smoothing in initial section [nan, nan, nan, nan]\r\nLabel image in initial section 0\r\nPosteriors after decision rule in initial section [nan, nan, nan, nan]\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThe K-means clustering correctly identified the peaks in the histogram corresponding to the 4 classes to within a small degree. The labelled output was blank, presumably due to the zeros and nans in the results above. It appears the program failed to calculate the initial posteriors correctly. Further results were not persued.\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\n\r\nThe implementation is an extension of ITK, and adds a utility class. The algorithm described is intended to ultimately be contributed also, once it has been rewritten as a proper ITK filter.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\n\r\nSource is provided to test the algorithm in the form of a command-line program, which appears to be portable. The paper describes how to use the code. However as it stands the algorithm is implemented as one monolithic function as main(), and is not reusable in its current form.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\n\r\nThe code did not build as published. The CMakeLists file needed to be changed to refer to the main driver program, and some corrections needed to be applied to KnowledgeBasedSegmentation.cxx in order to compile and run correctly:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n--- orig/KnowledgeBasedSegmentation.cxx 2005-09-16 18:03:11.898713993 +1000\r\n+++ ./KnowledgeBasedSegmentation.cxx 2005-09-16 19:27:30.498662560 +1000\r\n@@ -37,7 +37,7 @@\r\n int main( int argc, char * argv [] )\r\n {\r\n \r\n- if( argc < 8 )\r\n+ if( argc < 5 )\r\n {\r\n std::cerr << \"Missing command line arguments\" << std::endl;\r\n std::cerr << \"Parameters: inputFileName outputFileName nSmoothingIterations nClasses\" << std::endl;\r\n@@ -46,8 +46,8 @@\r\n \r\n char * rawDataFileName = argv[1];\r\n char * labelMapFileName = argv[2];\r\n- int nSmoothingIterations = argv[3]; // USER VARIABLE (DEFAULT = 10)\r\n- unsigned int nClasses = argv[4];\r\n+ int nSmoothingIterations = atoi(argv[3]); // USER VARIABLE (DEFAULT = 10)\r\n+ unsigned int nClasses = atoi(argv[4]);\r\n float timeStep = 0.1; // USER VARIABLE (DEFAULT = 0.1)\r\n float conductance = 3.0; // USER VARIABLE (DEFAULT = 3.0)\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThe implementation is provided largely in one very large main() function. This does not follow the principles of modular design, and prevents the algorithm being reused in other projects. The coding style is fairly consistent but sparsely commented.\r\n\r\nAs shown above, the program did not appear to run correctly to completion, so no real results were obtained.\r\n\r\nThe code uses only standard ITK and C library functions, and should be easily portable to common platforms.\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\n\r\nThis technique could be developed further and extended to apply to other k-class segmentation problems.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\n\r\nThe explanation of the algorithm design could benefit from expansion.\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\n\r\nWhy is the algorithm only working in 2D with individual slices?\r\n\r\nWhy does \"removing\" the bone improve the results? Surely it is simply another tissue class?\r\n\r\nWhy did you choose DICE to compare the segmentation results?\r\n\r\nIt would be very helpful to provide at least one test data set and the parameters required to reproduce the data you describe in the paper.\r\n\r\nSteps 2-4 need further explanation and discussion.\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\n\r\nMany people view the term \"knowledge-based\" as a fairly significant claim, often overused, in that \"knowledge\" is a very high-level concept implying experience, ideas and inferences. In other words, much more than just facts, data or statistics. In this case, the segmentation is ostensibly based on <i>a priori</i> statistics, which is arguably not the same as \"knowledge\".\r\n\r\nIn this instance, <i>a priori</i> information is not gathered from other training data sets. The statistics are gathered from the one image, and the cluster means are used to classify each voxel using a MAP approach. It is probably a stretch to call this \"knowledge-based\".\r\n\r\nThe paper does not discuss other statistical approaches, nor contextualise this research.\r\n\r\nAs the paper suggests this is part of ongoing work, the newer more developed versions could serve as a useful addition to the ITK codebase.\r\n",

   "abstract": "We have successfully created a software environment in which ultrasound data can be manipulated by, ITK (the Insight Tool-Kit), in real-time. We were able to access each frame generated within the resident computer of a TerasonTM Ultrasound Machine, convert it into the ITK image format, and demonstrate the concurrent operation of ITK on the same computer by writing the images to an external hard drive. At a rate of 10 frames per second, 512 by 512 pixel grayscale frames were written by ITK methods to the external hard drive through USB 2.0 while the ultrasound scan was occurring without thrashing or delay in system performance. This simple exercise demonstrates the potential of ITK in processing ultrasound images in real-time in addition to the more traditional off-line processing.",

The particular type of storage and file format can dramatically affect the speed of storage. Moreoever, the use of ITK for storage may also entail overhead which would affect performace (although I have not tested this). Also, the need for an intermediate step of OpenGL viewing seems peripheral if the main goal is only storage for offline analysis.\r\n",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThis paper describes the use of the Open Source software, the Insight Toolkit (ITK), for supporting a real-time system for processing ultrasound images at real-time, about 10 to 20 frames per second.\r\n \r\n\r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nThe point of the paper is to demonstrate that Open Source software is efficient enough for processing images at real-time rates, in this particular case at 10 frames per second.\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nThe authors developed a system that interfaces with an ultrasound probe (Terason), grabs images by using a clever trick through a copy of an OpenGL texture into memory, and then save the input images into files. The authors experimented by writing to a hard drive and to an external drive connected through a USB 2.0 port. Their observations indicate that 20 frames per second was to high of a rate for the system to sustain, while a rate of 10 frames per second was suitable for saving the images into disk and simultaneously displaying them using OpenGL.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nThe paper does not fully adhere to the practice of Open Science, because the content of the paper cannot be fully reproduced due to two reasons\r\n\r\n<ul> \r\n<li>The work relies on the use of a particular hardware and software, the Terason Ultra-Sound probe.\r\n<li>The source code was not provided\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThe paper is still a valuable contribution, since it let other developers know that Open Source is efficient enough for being used in real-time systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nThe exact work reported in the paper can not be reproduced by this reviewer due to lack of access to an Ultrasound probe and to the author's source code. However the reviewer could verify the performance claims made in this paper, by running similar processing and checking the time required to write images on disk.\r\n\r\nThis verication was done by using as source code a modification of the example:\r\n\r\n Insight/Examples/IO/ImageReadWrite.cxx\r\n\r\nThe pixel type in this code was changed from \"unsigned short\" to \"unsigned char\".\r\n\r\nIn this file, the try/catch block that invokes the writer->Update() method was put inside a for() loop from 0 to <100, and an itk::TimeProbe was added to Start() before the loop and to Stop() just after the loop. This test was set to write the image in a directory located in an external drive Maxtor \"OneTouch\", 120Gb, connected using a USB 2.0, through a USB hub of four ports. The code was run from a laptop DELL Latitude D810, with a Pentium M 750 at 1.86 GHz, running Windows XP. The code was compiled with Visual Studio .NET 2003, in Release mode.\r\n\r\nThe test used as input image the classical Lena at 512 x 512 from\r\n\r\n http://web.onetel.net.uk/~simonnihal/texcom/lena.html\r\n\r\n\r\nWriting this image 100 times in <b>PNG format</b>, in the USB 2.0 external drive took the following times (in seconds)\r\n\r\nTest 1 = 18.672\r\nTest 2 = 17.718\r\nTest 3 = 17.609\r\nTest 4 = 18.453\r\nTest 5 = 18.015\r\n\r\nThat is an average of 5.52 image per second.\r\n\r\nWhen a <b>JPEG format</b> was used for writing, with the default compression of the JPEG ImageIO writer in ITK , \r\nthe times (in seconds) became:\r\n\r\nTest 1 = 8.734\r\nTest 2 = 8.906\r\nTest 3 = 8.735\r\nTest 4 = 8.531\r\nTest 5 = 9.062\r\n\r\nThat is an average of 11.37 images per second.\r\n\r\nWhen using a <b>MetaImage</b> format, which is composed of a header file and an uncompressed raw binary file,\r\nthe times became:\r\n\r\nTest 1 = 4.406\r\nTest 2 = 5.062\r\nTest 3 = 5.312\r\nTest 4 = 4.859\r\nTest 5 = 5.453\r\n\r\nThat is an average of 19.92 images per second.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe authors do not mention the fileformat used for writing, but the values above indicate that the fileformat used for writing is a critical decision when performace is relevant to the writing process.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the reviewer verified that it is possible to write images of 8bits/pixel and 512 x 512 pixels into an external drive through a \r\nUSB 2.0 connection at rates of 10 to 20 images per second.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWriting in an internal hard hardrive of 60 Gb at 7200 RPM produced the following results, again for writing 100 images:\r\n\r\n<b>PNG format </b> in seconds\r\n\r\nTime 1 = 9.234\r\nTime 2 = 9.718\r\nTime 3 = 9.235\r\nTime 4 = 9.156\r\nTime 5 = 9.125\r\n\r\nThat is an average of 10.76 images per second.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>JPEG file format</b> in seconds\r\n\r\nTime 1 = 3.750\r\nTime 2 = 3.812\r\nTime 3 = 3.641\r\nTime 4 = 3.625\r\nTime 5 = 3.531\r\n\r\nThat is an average of 27.23 images per second\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MetaImage Format</b> in seconds\r\n\r\nTime 1 = 1.437\r\nTime 2 = 1.015\r\nTime 3 = 2.734\r\nTime 4 = 1.312\r\nTime 5 = 2.171\r\n\r\nThat is an average of 57.67 images per second, however, note the larger variability on the times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\n\r\nThe authors used the Insight Toolkit (ITK) which is an Open Source package for segmentation and registration of medical images.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\n\r\nThe authors do not provided their source code along with the paper.\r\nOnly code snippets are included in the text of the paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\n\r\nNot applicable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\n\r\nThe experiment perfomed by the authors is relevant in other image modalities. In particular for image guided surgery suported by fluoroscopic images, where having real time feedback is crucial for guiding the actions of the clinician.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work :</b>\r\n\r\nThe main question that comes to mind is how much actual image processing can be performed at the rates of 10 to 20 frames per second. For example, tracking of objects. It is worth to continue profiling different image analysis methods in the context of real-time systems. Such an effort will foster the improvement of the Open Source software available to the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors :</b>\r\n\r\nPlease let us know what image file format did you use in your experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n",

   "abstract": "We have previously developed an algorithm for locating boundaries in an image with sub-pixel resolution, as well as estimating boundary width and image intensity within the adjoining objects. The algorithm operates by finding the parameters of a cumulative Gaussian curve that best approximates an intensity profile taken across a boundary. If intensity is sampled along the image gradient across a boundary, it is reasonable to assume the profile approximates a finite portion of a cumulative Gaussian. Given that assumption, the first derivative of the profile should be the corresponding portion of a Gaussian, completely described by its mean, standard deviation, and amplitude. We present here a simple and rapid method to find those parameters, given that we only have a potentially skewed sample of the Gaussian. The parameters are approximated first for the finite sample, and then both ends of the Gaussian are extrapolated using the resulting parameters. New parameters are then calculated and the procedure is repeated. The optimization rapidly converges, yielding boundary location (mean) with sub-pixel accuracy as well boundary width (standard deviation). Integration then reproduces the cumulative Gaussian, and a least-squares fit is applied to estimate the constant of integration, from which intensity of the adjoining regions can be estimated.",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\n\r\nThe stated aim is to determine the location of the boundary between two different tissue types in a medical image at a \r\nsub-pixel resolution. The authors present an optimisation technique that fits a cumulative Gaussian curve to a set of \r\nsample points (intended to represent such a curve). The parameters calculated should then match the data, such that \r\nthe mean (mu) of the Gaussian can be used to determine the boundary point. This is demonstrated by generating a \r\ncurve (possibly adding noise) and sampling it, then passing this to the optimiser to fit.\r\n\r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\n\r\nThe hyopthesis is that a cumulative Gaussian can be fitted to an intensity profile to determine the location of a \r\nboundary between two tissue types. It assumes that the intensity profile of this boundary can be modelled by a \r\ncumulative Gaussian function, and furthermore that there exists a unique boundary that can be found by the profile.\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\n\r\nThe authors present results from testing on several generated curves. It shows how the RMS error (between the fitted \r\nand known parameters) for the curves tested goes rapidly to almost zero within a small number of iterations. This \r\nsupports the claim that their optimiser can fit a CG curve to a set of points derived from a 1D profile.\r\n\r\nNo evidence is presented (citation or data) to support the claim of the intensity profile being modelled by a Gaussian, \r\nor that this can be applied to images.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\n\r\nThe paper follows the tenets of Open Science; the source is provided, and the paper describes the algorithm as \r\nimplemented. The technique has not yet been applied to images, so there is no data to accompany it. All the \r\nparameters were provided to enable the reader to replicate the results presented in the paper.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\n\r\nI downloaded the code as supplied, and built it under Debian GNU/Linux on a Pentium 4 machine, using g++ 3.3.5, ITK \r\nCVS, VTK 4.2, FLTK 1.1. Apart from a few warnings, it built and ran fine.\r\n\r\nI ran the application with the default parameters, and it worked fine. Testing with a range of values seemed to \r\nproduce the expected results, and a good fit. One combination managed to cause a segfault (didn't manage to record \r\nthe settings).\r\n\r\n<b>Test Results</b>\r\n\r\nRunning with mu=5, sigma=2, I1=0, I2=100, samples=10, noise=[-1,1]: output information not displayed in GUI, but \r\nplot is displayed and fit looks very close. Mean fit error=0.0718168. Over 10 repeated runs, this would usually \r\nimprove to RMS fit error of 0.6, but occasionally the RMS error would increase and stabilise higher than the initial \r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nRunning with mu=10, sigma=5, I1=120, I2=900, samples=10, noise=[-10,10]: Fit error converges to about 6 after \r\naround 40 iterations. Mean error 2.78059. However Fitted mean=7.21941, fitted sigma=3.68412, fitted I1=121.483, \r\nfitted I2=589.68. The Upper asymptote is significantly out, despite fairly low overall fit error. These values of intensity \r\nare common for tissue-bone boundary, and are thus representative of real images.\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\n\r\nThe authors use the well-known combination of FLTK for the GUI and VTK for the charts. They do not discuss the \r\nimplementation or use of these libraries.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\n\r\nThe source was provided for the algorithm itself, in the style of an ITK algorithm. The primary class has already been \r\nsubmitted to ITK. This was accompanied by an FLTK/VTK application front-end to exercise the filter and plot the \r\nresults. It was immediately usable for testing once built.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\n\r\nThe code was generally readable and well-laid out. It tends to follow the conventions used in ITK and in the \r\nITKApplications suite, and was easily built on a Linux box with appropriate libraries installed. It seems to be fully \r\nportable.\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\n\r\nThe solution is in a sense a very general one, in that it provides a particular type of curve-fitting algorithm for a \r\ncumulative Gaussian. It could potentially be used in many statistical analysis problems. It may need to be developed \r\nfurther to see just where else it could be applied in image analysis.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\n\r\nThe conclusion mentions future work in segmentation based on boundary profiles. In terms of ITK, clearly the most \r\nimportant step is demonstrating this approach on real image data. Also, perhaps some of the work of Pizer et al with \r\ncores could be relevant here.\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\n\r\nGiven the results of this fitting (sigma, mu, etc) how do you calculate the actual boundary location?\r\n\r\nHow do you <b>know</b> the result is sub-pixel? What about scale issues and partial volume effect?\r\n\r\nHow are p1 and p2 (the sampling region) determined? How does this effect the optimization process?\r\n\r\nError function? How is the erf table generated? It would be useful to include at least the formula showing how they \r\nwere calculated.\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\n\r\nOnly a single paper is cited as related work (written by one of the coauthors). It would help to have the work placed in \r\nthe context of other related boundary finding techniques, showing how this approach differs.\r\n\r\nThis technique as described seems to only be applicable to a 1-Dimensional image intensity profile. The issue of first \r\ndetermining the orientation of the profile is not addressed, and thus cannot be directly applied to boundary analysis in \r\n2D or 3D images. As it stands it is assuming that there is a unique boundary point to be found, which may be in 1D but \r\nis only possible <i>for a given orientation at a given point</i> in 2D or 3D.\r\n\r\nThe Cumulative Gaussian appears to well describe the blurred intensity profile at the implicit boundary of two tissue \r\ntypes. However no mention is made of the Partial Volume Effect. It is not clear that this approach can afford to ignore \r\nthe PVE. Implicit in the selection of I_1 and I_2 is the fact that it must be chosen at sufficient distance from the \r\nboundary itself as to prove representative of the plateau intensity.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to explore the issue of scale also; say the ratio of the intensity delta (between I1 and I2) to the \r\nvoxel size. Perhaps skewness and kurtosis play a part here. You mention skew in the abstract but don't address it \r\ndirectly in the body. Is the boundary <i>always</i> symmetric? Given there will always be a finite sampling \r\nfrequency for any acquisition device, the tyranny of Nyquist's theorem places a limit on the smallest feature we can \r\nresolve. Size of point-spread function?\r\n\r\nThere is minimal analysis of the results and their implications. Section 5 talks about mu in terms of \"skew\", which one \r\nwould ordinarily associate with asymmetry of the curve tails. This is also confusing since mu is supposed to represent \r\nthe tissue boundary position.\r\n\r\nThe technique is not tested on either synthetic or real images. It would be great to see this applied to some real image \r\ndata. Or even a synthesised boundary (say between tissue and bone for CT) with noise and blurring added for good \r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\nOne of the stated assumptions is that the implicit boundary is essentially a step-function; that the actual tissue \r\nobserved transitions at one point from I1 to I2 (or asymptotically close). Sigma is equated with the boundary \"width\", \r\nbut really 1 standard deviation is only going to be 37% (or whatever the figure is) of the way to 1 (either plateau).\r\n\r\nThe algorithm attempts to estimate I1 and I2, the intensities of the two regions. But this is a given, surely? It is in the \r\nimage data, only determined by sigma, or the \"width\" of the boundary.\r\n\r\nNot sure about about discrete sampling - check Insight into Images.\r\n\r\nI think it would be a much stronger demonstration of the technique if it were applied to a simulated edge profile for \r\nvalidation. Since the only experiment is fitting a G curve to a G curve, it doesn't directly address the hypothesis that \r\nthis can find the boundary edge. Beginning with a 1D profile, two intensity levels could be chosen, and a random point \r\nchosen for the boundary. Then to simulate the mixture of the two intensities about the boundary, apply a smoothing \r\nfilter of an appropriate kernel size/scale. Finally the boundary position could be calculated from mu and compared with \r\nthe original known position.\r\n",

Contrast perfusion curves at anatomic points are analyzed to detect and localize tumors. The concept is that inter-scan deformations occur (one demonstration application is breast MR) and such deformations will confound the computation of perfusion corresponding anatomic points.\r\n\r\nThe research area is well motivated in the paper.

This is a very good research paper.\r\n\r\nThe paper will ideally motivate others to apply open-source software to their clinical research.\r\n\r\nThis paper has limited benefit to the open source community.

     "content": "It is clear that dynamic contrast MR imaging would benefit from image co-registration. Based on the image acquisition utilized in this paper, it is unclear if a nonlinear image registration is better than a rigid registration. While not described in sufficient detail in the paper, it appears that the dynamic contrast imaging has an image acquisition period of approximately 30 seconds. This is sufficient time to average several cardiac and respiratory cycles into the data causing blurring in the data as compared to non rigid motion as would be the case when using snapshot based imaging approaches. It is also unclear in the paper why histogram matching was used in comparison to a mutual information metric. The contrast changes in the area of the lesion are large (enhancement of 3 times) as shown in Figure 1. It is unclear if simple histogram matching is sufficient to allow the Thirion demon registration to work well in areas where there is a large change in contrast between the images.\r\n",

   "abstract": "The gold standard for measuring muscle regeneration in muscular dystrophy therapies is counting the number of dystrophin-positive muscle fibers on a cryostat muscle section immunostained for dystrophin. The standard process of manually counting a few thousand myofibers is tedious, time consuming, and limits quantitative analysis of a therapy success. We present an unsupervised method for segmenting and counting the number of myofibers on an immunofluorescent microscopy image. The key threshold selection problem is resolved by maximizing the number of sub-threshold connected components. Components significantly smaller than the known lower bound myofiber area, the only input parameter, are ignored to reduce noise. Validation on a series of images (n=63) revealed that our algorithm varied by less than 10% from manual counts in the relevant range of operation. The algorithm allows us to quantify three-dimensional dystrophin expression and design experiments that address a major limitation in muscular dystrophy therapies, the limited distribution of dystrophin after treatment. Further we have extended this method to segment and count objects in other immunofluorescent images. The method was quickly developed and tested using the Insight Toolkit (ITK), an open source C++ library for the development of image analysis software.",

A set of examples is included with the source code that is downloadable from www.cisst.org\r\nA detailed description of the architecture is presented, as well as an overview of the classes that will be available in the toolkit.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nThe paper does fully adhere to the principles of Open Science, since the software is distributed and the readers can check with the software the claims in the paper.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nThe reviewer downloaded the source code and built it under Cygwin, with gcc 3.4 and CMake 2.0.6.\r\n\r\nThe configuration of the software when smoothly without a single warning,\r\nThe compilation didn't generate errors or warnings, which indicates that the authors really put in place an effective system of quality control.\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nThe authors used \r\n\r\n* the netlib library (www.netlib.org) \r\n* the SWIG wrapper tool. \r\n* Cmake configuration tool\r\n* CVS for revision control\r\n* Dart for testing\r\n* Doxygen for code documentation\r\n* CVSTrac for bug tracking\r\n* CPPUnit and PyUnit for testing\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nThe authors distribute the source code at www.cisst.org\r\nDoxygen documentation is also available online and in a downloadable zip file.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nThe source code has a very standard of quality.\r\nIt is very structured, and follows a formal object oriented methodology. The authors used state of the art software engineering methodologies in the design, implementation and testing of the software. All of which is critical for software that is intended to be used in surgical applications.\r\n\r\nThe documentation of the classes is available online, \r\nhttp://www.cisst.org/resources/software/cisst-0.1.0/doc/doxygen/main.html\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nThe software described in the paper seems to be suitable for robotics applicaitons outside of the medical field, and the tracker functionalities can probably be used too in virtual reality applications.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nThe authors are strongly encouraged to follow the methodology of releasing early and releasing often. This maximize the feedback from the community and encourage the use of the software by a larger number of people.\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments</b>\r\nThe authors really need to make the download option more visible in their web site. This reviewer missed the option even after multiple passes through the page. \r\nReaders may easily get the impression that the software is not yet available.\r\n\r\nWhen visiting the web page of an open source software package the reviewer would expect the \"Download\" option to be close to the top, and quite highlighted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThis paper reviews and compares two methods for computing salient points in 3D medical images. A set of validation metrics are devised and used to compare the performance of the two methods on 13 MR images of the brain.\r\n \r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nNot applicable, as this paper is a comparison of existing methods.\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nThe results of the comparison of the two corner detection methods are given on 13 MR images of the brain.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nThe source code is available as an extension of ITK in the NA-MIC SandBox. As far as I can tell, the MR images used in the paper are not made available.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nI was able to download, compile and run the author\\\\\\'s source code with relative ease. The test programs ran without errors, and I ran the corner detectors on a provided synthetic binary image of a 3D box. It would be nice if the MR images from the paper were also provided, which would make the results of the paper fully reproducable.\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nThe software to compute the salient points is provided as an open source addition to ITK in the NA-MIC SandBox. There is little documentation on the usage of the programs, but they are simple command-line programs that are easy to figure out how to use. It might be useful to add in the top-level readme file a description of the two command line tools.\r\n\r\nThe validation metrics and the framework used to compile the statistics comparing the methods is not provided (at least I didn\\\\\\'t find them). This would be nice to have, as others might be interested in comparing yet other salient point detectors.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nThe salient point detectors are provided, and they are a very nice addition to ITK. Using the code in new software should be rather straightforward as the methods are implemented as ITK image filters.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nThe code looked clean and easy to read. There was sufficient comments I think to understand what the code does, especially when combined with the detailed description of the methods in the paper. One nit-picky suggestion is to make the top-level CMakeLists.txt file also compile the two example command-line programs.\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nThis code will be very helpful to researchers that want to find salient points in images, most likely for image registration.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\nAgain, it would be nice to have the MR images used and the framework for the validation.\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\nI would like to see just a little discussion/analysis of why the comparisons turned out the way they did. For instance, why is it that the correlation measurement showed better reproducability than the curvature measurement? My feeling is that this is because the correlation measurement is an expectation value in a small neighborhood, which might make it more robust to scale changes and registrations. Also, why is the curvature method more correlated to the entropy?\r\n\r\nOne point of the paper that I am confused with is whether the images used in the results are of the same subject or different subjects. You mention in the description of repeatability that salient points should be robust to images \\\\\\\"scanned at different times\\\\\\\", which makes it sound like the same subject scanned multiple times. And since the registration used is rigid, it appears that it is a single subject. Rigid registration of multiple subjects would not do a good job of aligning salient points, and thus it would be a poor measurement of repeatability.",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThis paper deals with topological correction of brain isosurface. The main idea is to mix surface approach (for handle detection) and image approach (for the correction part, faster and robust).\r\n \r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nThis paper is most definitly within the scope of open science. The code is based on VTK and everything (data, code and documentation) is given. Moreover, there is no publicly available toolkit for topology management so far. (note: guskov2001 papers goes with a binary). It should be noted that we are still lacking (in the open community) a suitable Data Structurefor rigorous topological work on surface meshes. The authors implemented an HE data structure that manage orientability and other components. Unfortunatly it seems to be bundled with application specific code. See below for a discussion on how this could be best profitable to open source community. \r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nI did not download the code and test it yet as the code is reported as not working.\r\nThis approach look pretty much alike the one from Wood04 where the authors used the isosurface (well, reeb-graph of iso surfaces and isocontours of the original image) to find the handles and \\\"repaired\\\" the mesh using the image. There too, MC was an intermediate step to recompute the corrected surface. This approach seems to be much simpler (which is a good thing) but the reader is left with no clue whatsoever about the underlying \\\"handle detection\\\" algorithm which unfortunatly is the core of the method. They seems to use a front propagation method on the isosurface to define a distance map (to what?), followed by a second pass where they detect the handles. The thing is, for each handle you have two specific \\\"class\\\" of loops (generators) that can be used to remove the handle. the first question is, how do you decide if you \\\"pintch\\\" the handle or \\\"fill\\\" the handle (dual operation, depending on the orientation of your surface)? Both operation lead to a genus - 1 surface, but very different ones. The second issue is that topology and geometry are disconnected. There is an infinity of loops that would be suitable to remove an handle in a topological sense. Here the authors seems to try to find the shortest one. Is that correct ? and if it is, why this one ? Are the authors sure they are getting the shortest one? I\\'m pretty much sure that the authors managed to removed all the handles in a topological sense (genus down to zero), I\\'m still wondering about if it\\'s done properly (and the definition of properly in this case is also an issue to be discussed with the biologists... Whatever \\\"properly\\\" is, it should be stated from the start as it impacts significantly the algorithm).\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nThey do use open source (VTK). \r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nFew details are given in the MICCAI paper, but the ppt contents more details. Most interestingly they somehow show that VTK does not contains the good structure for mesh processing. Even if the proposed structure contains some algorithm specific features, they implemented an Half-edge data-structure over the vtkPolyData. It would be interesting to see if the HE datastructure could be detached from the algorithm specific part (vtkPolyData -> vtkHalfEdgeMesh -> author code) and added to VTK toolkit. It would be also interesting to wonder if mesh processing features should be added to a VIZUALIZATION toolkit or to ITK which is dedicated to processing. The answer is most probably it should be integrated in ITK, but right now itk is lacking all the basic mesh processing filters vtk is providing..... A C-GAL - like mesh structure is definitly needed for mesh processing. By the way, how do the author insure closedness, 2-manifoldness (HE provides the orientation layer that vtkPolyData was not providing). Without those issues addressed, it seems difficult to treat topology rigorously (homology vs homotopy when the surface is not closed - we are working with surface of solid objects thus we should have 2-manifold, shall we let the end user handle that, or shall we enforce the 2-manfoldness in the DataStructure - ...).\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nDid not check that. Compilation reported broken. I believe the author to have several years experience with VTK from belgium to caltech, INRIA, MIT and now kitware, so the code should be well written.\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nthat topological could be of interest if control over the topology was given. The subject is verey active in graphical, mechanical and computational field. In medical field most people focus on brain, as the genus is known. It would be interesting to open the problem to a larger scale.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nHere are somef works on a possible solution for the all-surface approach (which does not address some of the \\\"mesh modification\\\" problems). I\\'m still somehow working on it, if the author want to have some discussions on the problem, I\\'m open.\r\nA. GOUAILLARD, C. ODET, X.

This is due to the strongly dependence with third-parties.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nI have compiled under linux and it works. We hope to try it under windows. I haven\\'t checked the source code style, but they say in their paper that they have used template programming\r\nand metaprogramming.\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nI think that this work is very useful in surgical simulation. Our group is working in this discipline, and thanks to the Open Source philosophy, we are installing/running/testing the toolkit to study the viability of including some of their work in our applications.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nAvoid the strong third-parties dependences.

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\n[Short description of the paper. In two or three phrases describe the problem that was addressed by the authors and the approach they took to solve it.]\r\n\r\nThis paper describes an open source toolkit for physics based simulation that has been used for research and education since 2001. The toolkit provides implementation of state of the art physics based algorithms and has been used for a variety of physics-based simulations, as demonstrated by the demos that accompany this paper.\r\n \r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\n[If Applicable: Describe the assumptions that the authors have made and they hypothesis of their work, note that not all papers will fit the model of hypothesis driven work, for example, the description of an image database, or the description of a toolkit will not be driven by an hypothesis, in which case, please simply write : \u00e2\u0080\u009cNon Applicable\u00e2\u0080\u009d in this field or delete the subtitle.]\r\n\r\nnot applicable\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\n[Describe the evidence that the authors provide in order to support their claims in the paper. This is a key component on Open Science, opinions that are not supported by evidence should be labeled as \u00e2\u0080\u009cspeculations\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cauthor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinion\u00e2\u0080\u009d while. The same rule applies to the text of the reviews: claims should be supported by evidence]\r\n\r\nnot applicable\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\n[Describe how much the paper and its addendums adhere to the concept of Open Science. Do the authors provide the source code of the programs used in their experiments? Do the authors provide the input images that they used? Or are those images publicly available? Do the authors provide the output images that they show in the paper? Do the authors provide enough details for you to be able to replicate their work?]\r\n\r\nThis paper adheres to the principle of open science. The source code is free and openly available for download with demos available. The user can either use the code as it is or adapt the source code for its own experiments/algorithms. The images are freely available.\r\nI have not downloaded the code for my own use, but the authors point out there is a steep learning curve to use the toolkit due to delayed documentation and advanced programming techniques such as generic and metaprogramming. However, the toolkit is used in the classroom, indicating that it can be used by university students.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\n[Did you reproduce the authors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 work?\r\nDid you download their code? Did you compile it? Did you run it?\r\nDid you managed to get the same results that they reported?\r\nWere there information missing from the paper, that was necessary for you to reproduce the work? Suggest improvements that will make easier for future readers to reproduce this work.]\r\nI have not downloaded the code.\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\n[Did the authors use Open Source software in their work? Do they describe their experience with it, advantages and disadvantages? Do they provide advice for future users of those Open Source packages?]\r\n\r\nThe authors used open source software released under the GNU Lesser General Public License.\r\nIn section 2, the authors point out that OpenTissue contains a variety of algorithms, but they fail to specify how many developers contributed, the number of principal developers and their experience in collaborating to develop open source code. This would be valuable information for other toolkit developers.\r\nIn section 3, the authors motivate the coding style of the toolkit (generic and metaprogramming) with the advantages (flexibility, more concise code, etc), disadvantages (compiler support, compiler errors). This is valuable information. The authors should also point out if they decided to use this coding style from the start, why, and if not, what made them decide to switch to this coding style.\r\nIn section 4, the authors point out that there is no clickable drag and drop GUI and motivate that choice.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\n[Do the author\u00e2\u0080\u0099s provide their source code? Is it in a form that is usable? Do they describe clearly how to use of the code? How long did it take you to use that code?]\r\nyes, the authors provide source code. \r\nThe other questions are not applicable since I didn\\\\\\'t download the code.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\n[If the authors provided their source code: Was the code easy to read? Did they use a modern coding style? Did they rely on non-portable mechanism? Was it suitable for multiple-platforms?]\r\nyes, the code uses modern coding style. The code relies on third party libraries (section 4), which limits it portability. The authors point out how to reduce that dependency.\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\n[Do you find that the authors methods can be applied to other image analysis problems? Suggest other disciplines or even other specific projects that could take advantage of this work]\r\nyes, this toolkit would be very useful for a computer graphics class, or even a physics class.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\n[Suggest to authors future directions for improving their methods, or other domains from which they could learn technique that could help them advance in their research.]\r\n\r\nfuture directions: since the toolkit is used in a classroom setting, this provide an ideal environment to conduct user studies. THe authors could set up experiments to learn how long it takes a student to learn particular skills, such as 1) basic use of the toolkit 2) does the toolkit improve their understanding of physics-based animation concepts? 3) how long/how easily did students learn modern programming skills 4) was the toolkit successful in helping students develop new algorithms?\r\n\r\nAnother improvement would be to find ways to improve the delayed documentation. In particular, are there ways to help the developers easily document code? Should documentation be mandatory? Should there be a template for documentation? \r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\n[Did you find that information was missing from the paper? Maybe parameters for running the tests? Maybe some images were missing? Would you like to get more details on how the diagrams, or plots were generated?]\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\n[This is a free-form field]\r\nThe demos are very impressive! This paper nicely presents the toolkit with its features, advantages and disadvantages. The multidisciplinary aspect of the toolkit is also very nice.\r\n\r\nTypo: there is a word missing at the end of the 4th sentence in section 2 (after \\\"physics-based\\\").\r\n",

   "abstract": "Since the 1970's B-splines have evolved to become the {\\em de facto} \r\nstandard for curve and surface representation due to many\r\nof their salient properties. Conventional least-squares \r\nscattered data fitting techniques for B-splines require the inversion \r\nof potentially large matrices. This is time-consuming as well \r\nas susceptible to ill-conditioning which leads to undesired\r\nresults. Lee {\\em et al.} proposed a novel B-spline \r\nalgorithm for fitting a 2-D cubic B-spline surface to scattered \r\ndata in \\cite{Lee}. The proposed algorithm utilizes an \r\noptional multilevel approach for better fitting results. \r\nWe generalize this technique to support $N$-dimensional \r\ndata fitting as well as arbitrary degree of B-spline. In addition, \r\nwe generalize the B-spline kernel function class to accommodate \r\nthis new image filter.",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThis paper describes an implementation of an image processing filter that given an image and a mask, will take the minimum value of the image among the pixels indicated by the mask, and will fill the image pixels (under the mask) with that value.\r\n \r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nNonApplicable\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nThe authors provide their source code, input images and outpur images, as well as a test. The output image provided by the author was replicated by this reviewer.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nThe paper follows quite well the principles of Open Science. The source code, and images are provided, as well as a test that makes very easy to run the filter.\r\nI wished the author would have added a bit more on the background of this filter, althought the references to the book by Soille is probably what I should follow. A more compeling example of the applicability of this filter would have been nice too. For example, the original motivation of the author for implementing this filter, but again, the author refers to other publications for details on applications for which this filter is suitable.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nThe author work was easy to reproduce. All the material was included in the submission. The reviewed configured, compiled and ran the code without modifications and with minimal effort. The reviewer tested this code in a Linux Debian machine with a dual pentium IV at 2.4Ghz, and 1Gbyte of RAM. The output of the test matched well the image provided by the author. There was no information missing as far as replicating the work was concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nThe author uses ITK and contributes a new ITK image filter, actually based on a previous contribution by the same author.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nThe author contributes his source code, there are some questionable practices in the implementation of the filter, such as the arbitrary shifting of the image intensities, but they are at least well documented upfront, so the use is aware that they are being performed when the filter is executed.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nThe code has good quality. It should run in multiple platforms, although the reviewer only tried it on Linux with gcc 3.4. The code respects most of the ITK coding style. Minimal modifications would be needed for including this filter in the ITK toolkit.\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nI would have to consult the references cited by the author in order to get more familiar with potential applications.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nIt would seem that a similar filter could be implemented for imposing the maxima from a mask.\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\nAs I mention before, it would have been nice to have a more compeling story for the need of this filter, and its applications. The author went quite to the point on how the filter was implemented and how to use it. An example of what the author is actually doing with this filter would have improve the paper.\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n",

However the paper could explain the result with more details.\r\nIn a reply to the previous review, the author gives some context information about the minima-imposition technique and the problem he tries to address.\r\nAn illustration of this problem could help potential users understand how this filter could be useful in their applications.\r\nBesides some theoretical background would not hurt (given only the table of contents of the book of Soille is Open Science!).\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nI very much appreciate the author\\\\\\'s initiative to provide not only the materials to reproduce the results, but also the TeX files to reproduce the paper.\r\nOpen Science all the way!\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nI reproduced the reported result using the input image provided: the resulting image looks identical as the test image that comes in the tar file.\r\nThe code compiled smoothly with MS VS8.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source:</b>\r\nThe code is implemented as an ITK filter that embeds a sequence of filters. Code quality is excellent.\r\nCould the algorithm be modified to remove the shift filter and gain additional performance?\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nI would suggest to describe an application where this filter could be useful, or even better to illustrate such an application with an example.",

Nothing is described to let people know about expected result.\r\n\r\n#1. The code is missing a CMakeLists.txt file. Here is the one I used:\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nPROJECT(ITKMINC)\r\nFIND_PACKAGE(ITK REQUIRED)\r\nINCLUDE(${ITK_USE_FILE})\r\nINCLUDE(${ITKMINC_SOURCE_DIR}/FindMINC2.cmake)\r\nINCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${MINC2_INCLUDE_DIR})\r\nADD_EXECUTABLE(itkminc itkMINC2ImageIOTest.cxx itkMINC2ImageIO.cxx)\r\nTARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(itkminc ITKIO ${MINC2_LIBRARIES} hdf5 netcdf)\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nand I also wrote a FindMINC2.cmake since the library is not so standard (very new)\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nFIND_PATH(MINC2_INCLUDE_DIR minc2.h\r\n/usr/include\r\n/usr/local/include\r\n)\r\nFIND_LIBRARY(MINC2_LIBRARIES minc2\r\n/usr/lib\r\n/usr/local/lib\r\n)\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThen on a regular debian system you also need to install the following package:\r\nnetcdfg-dev\r\nlibhdf5-serial-dev\r\nRecommended package are:\r\nminc-tools\r\nhdf5-tools\r\n(although minc-tools only support minc1 file).\r\n\r\nI ran into multiple compilation issues, first one is none const correctness which is a big issue for ITK. I made some change to the code to replacer \\\\\\'char*\\\\\\' with std::string and char** with std::vector<std::string>\r\nThis affect: GetDimensionOrder / SetDimensionOrder\r\nFurthermore m_DimensionOrder was leaking (not destroyed in destructor) replacing it with std::string, ensure both const correctness and prevent memory leak. Same problem with m_DimensionName (never deleted).\r\nThen the test file try to includes: itkMINC2ImageIOFactory.h which not available, removing the guilty line fix the compilation\r\nThere is problem with #define MINC2_MAXDIM 10 what does it refers to ? This is only in the cxx, and not header, this cannot be user driven. More comment should be made about this #define\r\nEven after all those patch the code compiles with lots of warnings:\r\n\r\n/tmp/minc/itkMINC2ImageIO.cxx: In member function \\\\\\'virtual void itk::MINC2ImageIO::Read(void*)\\\\\\':\r\n/tmp/minc/itkMINC2ImageIO.cxx:111: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions\r\n/tmp/minc/itkMINC2ImageIO.cxx: In member function \\\\\\'virtual void itk::MINC2ImageIO::ReadImageInformation()\\\\\\':\r\n/tmp/minc/itkMINC2ImageIO.cxx:253: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions\r\n/tmp/minc/itkMINC2ImageIO.cxx:354: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions\r\n/tmp/minc/itkMINC2ImageIO.cxx: In member function \\\\\\'virtual void itk::MINC2ImageIO::Write(const void*)\\\\\\':\r\n/tmp/minc/itkMINC2ImageIO.cxx:474: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions\r\n/tmp/minc/itkMINC2ImageIO.cxx:479: warning: unused variable \\\\\\'dimseparation\\\\\\'\r\n/tmp/minc/itkMINC2ImageIO.cxx:480: warning: unused variable \\\\\\'dimstart\\\\\\'\r\n/tmp/minc/itkMINC2ImageIO.cxx:581: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions\r\n/tmp/minc/itkMINC2ImageIO.cxx:538: warning: unused variable \\\\\\'minval\\\\\\'\r\n/tmp/minc/itkMINC2ImageIO.cxx:539: warning: unused variable \\\\\\'maxval\\\\\\'\r\n/tmp/minc/itkMINC2ImageIO.cxx:541: warning: unused variable \\\\\\'nChannels\\\\\\'\r\n/tmp/minc/itkMINC2ImageIO.cxx: At global scope:\r\n/tmp/minc/itkMINC2ImageIO.cxx:593: warning: unused parameter \\\\\\'fileName\\\\\\'\r\n/tmp/minc/itkMINC2ImageIO.cxx:593: warning: unused parameter \\\\\\'buffer\\\\\\'\r\n/tmp/minc/itkMINC2ImageIO.cxx: In member function \\\\\\'void itk::MINC2ImageIO::SetSliceScalingFromLocalScaling(mivolume*)\\\\\\':\r\n/tmp/minc/itkMINC2ImageIO.cxx:631: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions\r\n/tmp/minc/itkMINC2ImageIO.cxx:636: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions\r\n\r\nRunning through valgrind lead to the following memory leak:\r\nRunning the example throught valgrind lead to the following problems:\r\n\r\n==22892== Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)\r\n==22892== at 0x80AB747: _miget_volume_class (volume.c:885)\r\n==22892== by 0x80ABFBB: miopen_volume (volume.c:1061)\r\n==22892== by 0x809A392: itk::MINC2ImageIO::ReadImageInformation() (itkMINC2ImageIO.cxx:190)\r\n==22892== by 0x80945BE: itk::ImageFileReader<itk::Image<unsigned short, 3>, itk::DefaultConvertPixelTraits<unsigned short> >::GenerateOutputInformation() (itkImageFileReader.txx:138)\r\n==22892== by 0x475BF12: itk::ProcessObject::UpdateOutputInformation() (itkProcessObject.cxx:690)\r\n==22892== by 0x8083FFD: itk::ImageBase<3>::UpdateOutputInformation() (itkImageBase.txx:174)\r\n==22892== by 0x471692F: itk::DataObject::Update() (itkDataObject.cxx:342)\r\n==22892== by 0x475BFCC: itk::ProcessObject::Update() (itkProcessObject.cxx:554)\r\n==22892== by 0x806E804: main (itkMINC2ImageIOTest.cxx:71)\r\n\r\nInspecting result, using the micnc tools still gives some errors are reported:\r\n$ mincstats LF2.mnc\r\n*** /tmp/minc-install/bin/mincstats - reported max (6) doesn\\\\\\'t equal header (255)\r\n$ mincstats test5.mnc\r\n*** /tmp/minc-install/bin/mincstats - reported max (0.0015259) doesn\\\\\\'t equal header (1)\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nThe provided code will allow the open source ITK package to read the file format of the open source MINC tools. It is entirely open source based.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nAuthor did provide part of the code they use. More code need to be sent for full integration into ITK. See Reproducibility for problems at compile time.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nOn overall the code did not respect ITK coding style ( identation, comment, use of cerr instead of itkDebugMacro). there are at least two functions not used:\r\nReadVolume and WriteSlice. There are some commented code at toplevel of cxx file.\r\n\r\nThe code itself might also be leaking since I can see a:\r\n midimhandle_t *hdims = new midimhandle_t[m_NDims];\r\nbut nowhere can I find a delete[]\r\n\r\nAnd a minor problem is the use of const char pointer instead of cstring:\r\n const char *vname = \\\\\\\"vector_dimension\\\\\\\";\r\nshould be\r\n const char vname[] = \\\\\\\"vector_dimension\\\\\\\";\r\n\r\nLast point: the code is not PIMPLed. This means that ITK will have to include netcdf, hdf and minc header file every time one include the itkMINC2 header.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nThe code should be reviewed by author for next submission. More test should be written to. In particular it should not segfault on minc1 file. Commented code should go away, unused code too.\r\nAlso submission to Insight Journal require the use of template. As far as I understand this is not the case:\r\nhttp://www.itk.org/Wiki/ITK_Procedure_for_Contributing_New_Classes_and_Algorithms#How_to_Prepare_a_Submission_to_the_Insight_Journal\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\nAs usual file format are the entry point to ITK world and therefore is always very welcome. \r\nAs a side note the external libraries involve are huge, therefore I would delay until some agreement is made for which library actually goes into ITK.\r\n",

     "content": "<FONT COLOR=\\\"red\\\">UPDATE:</FONT>\r\nAfter corresponding with the author, i would adjust my comments somewhat. Specifically, the reader was never intended to read minc version 1 files, so the fact that it doesn\\'t is not really a problem. Some problems that i was having were due to a faulty build of the minctools i was using, rather than anything to do with this code particularly.\r\n\r\nFor those who might like to use this module, i would point out two things: \r\n<OL>\r\n<LI>You can convert your old minc 1 files, such as brainweb files, to minc 2 using the mincconvert utility found on the website listed in the paper. Note that mincconvert does not automatically get installed with the release that I used (2.0.09), you have to manually install it, this should be fixed in the next release The command line to use is:\r\n<CODE>\r\nmincconvert -2 input.mnc output.mnc\r\n</CODE>\r\n<LI>Secondly, when i built the minc tools, i ran into problems using the HDF library version 1.6.5, but it works fine with 1.6.4. I am not sure why, but if you experience HDF errors when trying to convert minc files, this may be the source of the trouble.\r\n</OL>\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThe paper presents code to enable ITK to read and write the MINC2 file format.\r\n \r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nThe authors provide a small test program which manipulates one test dataset that is provided. The test strategy seems to be visual - the results of the program are inspected for correctness by eye - rather than numerical.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nThe paper adheres to the principles of open science. The work is reproducible.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nI downloaded, compiled and ran the code. In that sense I reproduced the work. However the test strategy may not be adequate to fully test the code.\r\n\r\nAs an example, I tried to use the code to read my own data, but I had difficulty. I was only able to read the data provided with the code. In particular, i was not able to read data from MNI Brainweb, which would probably be a major use of this module. I got the following error in all cases:\r\n<CODE>\r\nrbrook@spender{IO}../../test/itkMINC2ImageIOTest ~/t1_icbm_normal_1mm_pn3_rf20.mnc \r\n This is a test for MINC2!!\r\nexception in file reader \r\nitk::ERROR: MINC2ImageIO(0x85a9b80): Unknown component type: 0\r\nUnknown\r\n</CODE>\r\nI am not sure if this problem was due to my data being in MINC1 format, or other reasons. The MINC2 library is supposed to be backwards compatible with MINC1, but it may be the case that the module presented here does not support reading minc1. I did not pursue this in great detail at this time.\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nThe provided code will allow the open source ITK package to read the file format of the open source MINC tools. It is entirely open source based.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nSource code is provided, however, it does not compile without editing. The line\r\n<CODE>\r\n#include \\\"itkMINC2ImageIOFactory.h\\\"\r\n</CODE>\r\nmust be commented out of itkMINC2ImageIOTest.cxx for it to compile. Furthermore, the writing in the paper implies that other code may exist that was not provided. Specifically, they mention that the module was added to ITK as an advanced option, but no CMAKE was provided. Also, the use of the pluggable factories was discussed - but an itkMINC2ImageIOFactory class was not provided. The commented line above implies that it exists somewhere.\r\n\r\nAdditional documentation on building the needed external libraries may be helpful. To assist other reviewers, i give some tips here - these worked for me on RedHat8 linux, there may be other and better solutions.\r\n<OL>\r\n<LI>In addition to the minc2, hdf and netcdf libraries, i found that the szip library was also required. Its true that its required for HDF, not for this code particularly, but its still useful to know.\r\n<LI>When building and installing these libraries, build and install them in this order: netcdf, szip, hdf, minc2.\r\n<LI>When linking the provided code, i found that the following link order worked \r\n<CODE><.o files> ... other stuff.... -lminc2 -lnetcdf -lhdf5 -lsz -lz </CODE>\r\n</OL>\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nThe authors name and affiliation only appears in the .h file, not at the top of the .cxx file. The test file does not seem to meet the ITK testing standard of testing every method thoroughly. Beyond that, I did not read the code in detail.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nI think that a more thorough test strategy would be needed to verify the code. As an example, minc is capable of storing data internally in any orientation and order (that is xyz, zyx, row major, column major, etc). I have seen other minc reading code work (using the minc1.4 library) on some orders and not others, so a thorough testing is required. Same applies for different numbers of dimensions, and different types of data (byte, int, etc).\r\n\r\nAdding the Factory classes would be very useful. \r\n\r\nA CMAKE build script, or instructions for modding the ITK CMakeList would also be helpful.\r\n\r\nIs the code intended to read MINC version 1 files? The minc2 library should be capable of it and this would be useful. \r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\nI think that this is an extremely useful contribution. Once tested and shown to be reliable, i would probably use this daily in my work. The MINC tools provide a valuable set of open source medical imaging tools, complementary to ITK. Furthermore, there is much data available in MINC, and the conversion process into a format that ITK can read and vice versa is time-consuming and risks losing data. \r\n\r\nWith regard to the paper itself, it would be important to add the author and date somewhere. It is not obvious how to contact the author. Style and grammar wise there are some issues, but as the main contribution is the code, i consider this relatively less important.",

It appears that the most recent version of minc2 changed the API slightly, resulting in compilation errors for this project. Earlier versions had problems with some releases of hdf5. I hope that these are issues that will get sorted out with time.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\nA good start for what should become a very valuable contribution.",

Two approaches are presented and compared: 1. the current ITK approach using the HConvexImageFilter and HConcaveImageFilter, and 2. a new approach using a simple flooding-based algorithm (referred to by the authors as <i>ValuedRegionalExtremaImageFilter</i>).\r\n \r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nThe hypothesis is that the ValuedRegionalExtremaImageFilter approach is computational faster than the HConvexImageFilter/HConcaveImageFilter approach.

     "content": "<b>Compiling matitk.dll</b>\r\nI was able to compile the code with VS71 as the compiler. If the matlab version you have is old (for instance 6.5), you will need to get the <a href=\\\"http://www.mathworks.com/support/solutions/data/1-1BRI9.html?solution=1-1BRI9\\\">options file</a> for VS71.\r\n\r\nI made the suggested changes to the bin/win32/mexopts/msvc71opts.bat file. (setting ITKBIN, ITKSRC environment variables and adding the working directory to the list paths. <tt>path(path,\\\"c:/tmp/foo\\\")</tt>).\r\n\r\nI had two errors compiling the code, since the code was instantiating curvature flow filters etc on unsigned int images. The errors were trivial to remove. Below is the patch to remove the compiler errors and will be fixed in ITK CVS.\r\n\r\nRegarding the dll shipped with the paper, the permissions of the dll needs to have executable permission otherwise matlab fails to load the dll.\r\n\r\n<b>Testing</b>\r\n\r\nI was able to load the built in mri dataset and perform filtering etc in a jiffy. That was convenient.\r\n\r\n<b>Usability</b>\r\n\r\nTraditionally matlab has been a storehouse for well established image processing/ enhancement algorithms. There are several external analysis packages available such as LightSpeed, SPM etc.. I do not know of any packages that perform registration. ITK on the other hand has bleeding edge segmentation and registration algorithms along with basic image processing algorithms. \r\n\r\nA very useful thing to do will be to conveniently perform registration in ITK and continue with filtering and analysis in MATLAB, since MATLAB lacks registration algorithms. MATITK provides two registration algorithms, Demos and TPS. I tried out Demons and it seemed to work fine. It should probably supply a lot more registration algorithms. Also, there is no way to currently specify the origin or the images. For instance the fixed and moving images could be acquired in different reference frames.\r\n\r\nAny submission to MATLAB central ?\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Inclusion in the toolkit</b>\r\n\r\nI propose the framework be included with InsightApplications.

   "abstract": "Probability distributions are a key component of clinical research. One only has to make a cursory review of clinical literature to realize that nearly all clinical publications reference some sort of statistical test; be it t-test, chi-squared test, or F-test. In this paper, we describe an architecture for providing the Insight Toolkit with access to probability distributions. The architecture can support parametric and nonparametric probability distributions. Each distribution provides access to its probability density function (PDF), cumulative distribution function (CDF), inverse cumulative distribution function (inverse CDF), mean, and variance. These methods form the basis of statistical tests.",

     "content": "This submission provides a functor style filter to perform operations similar to the AccumulateImageFilter.\r\n\r\nThe difference with respect to the AccumulateImageFilter is that this filter is templated over a functor. This allows a variety of accumulation methods (mean, min, max, median, etc.). This makes a nice design, allowing it to be easily extended by providing a new functor to perform the \\\"accumulation\\\" of a dimension.\r\n\r\nWe have discussed extending the AccumulateImageFilter with additional methods using a set of modes. The functor style allows for the filter to be extended more easily.\r\n\r\nThe author indicates the AccumulateImageFilter cannot be modified to do this without jeapordizing backward compatibility. I offer two suggestions that may address this:\r\n\r\n1. AccumulateImageFilter could be made a subclass of the ProjectionImageFilter, where the subclass specifies a functor that allows the current AccumulateImageFilter functionality (mean and sum).\r\n2. Or, the AccumulateImageFilter could be extended to have an extra template parameter (the functor) but that template parameter will default to the function that provides the current AccumulateImageFilter functionality.\r\n\r\nA comment on the API. The AccumulateImageFilter use Set/GetAccumulateDimension() methods to indicate the projection direction. The filter in this submission provides a Set/GetAxe() method. I suggest the Set/GetAxe be renamed to Set/GetAccumulateDimension(). Alternatively, the method could be Set/GetAxis(). However, in ITK we never refer to a dimension as an axis. So the method should really be Set/Get*Dimension() (perhaps Set/GetProjectionDimension()).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I would like to pass on a few thoughts on the subject.<br /></font><font size=\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"><br />I would certainly agree with the author&#39;s comment on page 2, that the `pure&#39; implementation may perform better than the one implemented in ITK. At the heart of the original downhill algorithm was an assumption of integer data. I wouldn&#39;t hesitate in recommending Vincent&#39;s algorithm over my own where non-integer data is to be accommodated. I have never so far found myself working with other than integer data in my career in medical image analysis, hence my own design decisions in this regard. The core of the algorithm is the dynamically allocated `istart&#39; array (see [1], Appendix B, page B-15) which effectively implements an ordered array of lifo lists. This approach cannot be taken with non-integer data. For full details of the algorithm see Chapter 4 of [1], which is an expanded version of the Pattern Recognition Letters paper cited by the author.<br /><br />It is interesting to note (though not necessarily significant) that the time for processing the `cthead&#39; test image (0.0218) reported in the authors paper is identical to that reported in [1] for the same (Vincent) algorithm applied to another 256x256 test image (Study 2 MIP, see [1], Table 4.2, p110). In this case the downhill algorithm took just 0.0094 seconds to perform the same processing, while the modified ITK version reported in the author&#39;s paper took 0.1324. I would conclude (not having examined the ITK code in detail) that the port to a non-integer handling algorithm has, of necessity, neutralised the performance gains of the original downhill filter design.<br /><br />Finally it may be of interest that a number of other image processing filters can be approached in a similar way, for instance the grassfire distance transform. Again see Chapter 4 and Appendix B of [1], for more details.<br /><br />[1] Efficient pre-segmentation filtering in mrcp, K Robinson.

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThis papers describes the implementation of a exact signed distance map as an ITK filter according to the paper by Maurer et al. This implementation is compared against the current Danielsson distance map existing in ITK.\r\n\r\n \r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nIt was claimed that the Maurer algorithm for computing distance maps was more efficient than the method by Danielsson. The ITK toolkit only had an implementation of the Danielsson filter and was lacking the implementation of Maurer\\\\\\'s algorithm. By providing now open source implementation of these two very useful methods, it becomes possible to experimentally verify the performance ratio between these two algorithms. It is reasonable to expect that the availability of this comparison will encourage improvements in the open source implementations of each one of them.\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nThe authors ran the existing Danielsson distance map and their new implementation of the Maurer\\\\\\'s algorigthm in a set of synthetic binary images, both in 2D and 3D. Computational times for these test are reported in the paper.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nThe papers is an excellent example of the Open Science methodology. The description of the problem is clear and direct. The authors provide the source code of the implemented filter as well as tests for running the filter in several synthetc images. The input images and output images are provided. \r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nThe material provided by the authors was sufficient for reproducing the work. It took only about 30 minutes to download, configure, build and run the code with its tests.\r\n\r\nThe only minor drawback was that the CMakeLists.txt file provided by the authors assumes that the code is going to be built in-place, and that the images resulting from the tests will be put in the Source directory also. This reviewer used the code in an out-of-source build, and therefore was forced to make a couple of changes in the CMakeLists.txt file. The section changed was the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADD_TEST(Run1 ${SignedMaurerDistanceMapImageFilterTest} \r\n ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/binaryPhantom.hdr ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/out1.hdr)\r\nADD_TEST(CompareImage1 ImageCompare ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/out1.hdr\r\n ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/binaryPhantom_out.hdr)\r\n\r\nADD_TEST(Run2 ${SignedMaurerDistanceMapImageFilterTest} \r\n ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/SquareBinary201.hdr ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/out2.hdr)\r\nADD_TEST(CompareImage2 ImageCompare ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/out2.hdr\r\n ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/SquareBinary201_out.hdr)\r\n\r\nADD_TEST(Run3 ${SignedMaurerDistanceMapImageFilterTest} \r\n ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/peep0_seg01.hdr ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/out3.hdr)\r\nADD_TEST(CompareImage3 ImageCompare ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/out3.hdr\r\n ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/peep0_seg01_out.hdr)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere the \\\\\\\"${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}\\\\\\\" was added before \\\\\\\"out.hdr\\\\\\\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will also be desirable to use names out1.hdr, out2.hdr, and out3.hdr for each one of the test,\r\nin that way the three images will still be availble at the end of the test. There is not need to reuse\r\nthe filename, since these images are pretty small anyways.\r\n\r\nThe reviewer used this code in Cygwing wth gcc 3.4, in a laptop Dell D810 with Pentium 4 at 1.86Ghz.\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nThe authors made the optimal combination of open source use. Their work is based on open source tools (ITK), and their contribution is also sent back as an open source filter .\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nThe source code is in very good shape. It was possible to use it without any modifications. The distance map filter contributed by the authors is already in the form of an ITK filter, and could be included in the ITK toolkit with minimal modifications, mostly related to coding style.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nThe provided has good quality and already follows most of the ITK coding practices. The authors also included in their implementation a very similar API to the one of the Danielsson distance. It is therefore very easy to replace one with the other in the places where a distance map filter is needed.\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nThe Distance Map filter is an extremely useful tool in medical image processing. The superior performance of the Maurer\\\\\\'s algorithm with respect to the Danielsson algorithms seems to indicate that this new implementation should replace the Danielsson distance in some places in the Toolkit. For example in the CannyLevelSet segmentation filter.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nThe RemoveEDT() method could probably be speed up by using an inlined implementation. \r\nThe use of acronyms such as EDT is dicouraged in ITK. It will be more convenient to use the full spelling : ExactDistanceTransform.\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\nThe authors mention in the paper, evaluations of the method in 3D images. It would have been nice to include those 3D images along with the 2D ones. The infrastructure of the Insight Journal would have supported those images easily, and will have provided a convincing evidence to readers that the filter is effective in 3D.\r\n\r\nThe comparision of the output between the Maurer\\'s and Danielsson\\'s filter should have included a subtraction of the two output images. The paper presents the two images, which at naked eye look identical. It is interesting however to compute the difference and illustrates the kind of patterns that the difference image will have. This will be useful for those who need to make a decision regarding which one of these two filters to use. The filter SquaredDifferencesImageFilter could provided this comparison easily.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.itk.org/Insight/Doxygen/html/classitk_1_1SquaredDifferenceImageFilter.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis reviewer was able to verify the good behavior of the filter in a 3D image, by just chaning the dimension of the image in the test provided by the authors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\nThis is an excellent contribution to the medical image processing community, and a success story for the approach of Open Science and electronic publishing. The posting of this paper made possible in a single day to improve performance in method used by other groups in the country. Despite the fact that this algorithm has been published for about 3 years, this new open source implementation raises its impact by making it inmediately available to readers. We anticipate that this filter will make it soon to a future release of the ITK toolkit.\r\n\r\n",

CMake was confused about this.\r\nThe following lines:\r\n\r\n #Add Source\r\n #SUBDIRS(Source)\r\n\r\nshould be removed from the main CMakeLists.txt\r\nThis is why the code is not showing up on the Insight Journal website.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nThe code looks good and respects ITK style for the most part.\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\na) I could not find the RecomputeContinuousGaussianKernel() function in the current ITK cvs class.\r\nb) The plan is to test that the current ITK cvs is broken.\r\nThe best way is to add the current test Insight/Testing/Code/Common/itkGaussianDerivativeImageFunctionTest.cxx in your publication\r\nand add a test for spaced images at the end of this test. It would be great if you can submit a new revision with this modification.\r\nc) Why is this code not working in 3D?\r\n\r\n<b>Other comments</b>\r\nThis is a very good work.

   "abstract": "Various metrics have been proposed in the literature for performing intrinsic automatic image to image registration. Among these measures, mutual information is a very popular one because of its robustness and accuracy for a wide variety of applications. In this paper, we propose a filter for performing non-rigid registration by estimating a dense deformation field derived from the mutual information metric. This filter takes place in the ITK PDE deformable registration design like the Demons algorithm of Thirion. We also show how the concept of metric flow is conceptually linked to the concept of metric derivative for a prior transformation model by the transformation jacobian. We also suggest a sparse implementation of the GetJacobian() method for reducing the computation time of a metric derivative for local transformations models.",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThis paper describes the implementation of an enhanced wrapping system for ITK. The wrappers allow access to ITK filters, algorithms and pipelines using Python (TCL and Java are on the way: waiting for other contributers/helpers).\r\n \r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nThis paper suggests that the proposed wrapping system is easier to use, better documented, and more Python friendly than the current wrapping system.\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nThe authors present an easy to follow installation guide, a developers guide, and various examples demonstrating usage. The code is easy to understand and the Python functionality really streamlines prototyping with ITK. I have not personally used the existing wrapping system, but my experience with WrapITK has been extremely positivie. The claims made by the authors (ease of use, good documentation, and Python friendly) are well supported from the article examples and my own usage/exploration.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nThe authors provide the cmake files for the wrapping system and point to other required software - all publically available (ie. CMake, ITK, and CableSwig).\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nI was able to download, configure, and compile WrapITK (with some minor issues - see below). \r\n\r\nMy system configuration was as follows:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Operating System=Windows XP SP2\r\n<li>CMake=CMake 2.4.2\r\n<li>Compiler=Microsoft.NET 2003 (7.1.3088)\r\n<li>ITK=InsightToolkit-2.8.1\r\n<li>CableSwig=CVS checkout on 10th July 2006, 9:30AM (GMT+10:00)\r\n<li>WrapITK=Nightly archive from http://voxel.jouy.inra.fr/darcs/contrib-itk/WrapITK/WrapITK.tar.gz downloaded on 10th July 2006, 8:45AM (GMT+10:00)\r\n<li>Python=Python 2.4.3 (#69, Mar 29 2006, 17:35:34) [MSC v.1310 32 bit (Intel)] on win32\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nI applied the given patches, and I worked through most of the examples and achieved the same/similar results.\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nUses CMake, ITK, CableSwig, GCC_XML, Python.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nAll source code is provided.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nThe code is easy to read, and the installation/developer guides are easy to follow.\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nWrapITK allows for easy prototyping with ITK. I have been using ITK for various image analysis tasks for ~12months, and have found prototyping to be a somewhat tedious task (ie. create a temp CMake project, create main file, add includes, add all input arguments, compile, run, and repeat). Prototyping with WrapITK is <b><i>very</i></b> easy and can be achieved using either the command line interpreter or custom scripts. While the setup time may be large (it took me ~1 day to download, configure, and compile all components), I envisage that the time/engery/frustration I will save using WrapITK to prototype will far outweigh this initial outlay of time.\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\nThe article should be updated to include the itk.echo(.) function and itk.pipeline class from itkExtras/__init__.py.\r\n\r\n<b>Minor issues compiling WrapITK:</b>\r\nI encountered some minor issues compiling WrapITK on Windows. I have detailed these in an email sent to insight-users@itk.org on 11th July 2006 (http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/insight-users/2006-July/018621.html).\r\n\r\nThese issues included:\r\n1. Error accessing __FUNCSIG__ in itkGDCMSeriesFileNames.h.\r\n2. Object file format limit exceeded error (C1128) when selecting extra types to wrap (ie. setting WRAP_unsigned_short=ON).\r\n3. Ambiguous call to overloaded function \\\\\\'sqrt\\\\\\' in itkSignedMaurerDistanceMapImageFilter.txx\r\n4. Error accessing protected member EnlargeOutputRequestedRegion(.) in itkScalarConnectedComponentImageFilter.cxx.\r\n5. Minor error with Python site-packages installation for Windows.\r\n6. Incorrect string formatting in Python win32.\r\n",

For the first metric a two time speed-up can be\r\nachieved by rewriting the code to loop only once over the fixed image. This is instead of the two times that is used in the current ITK code. The reduction in computation time comes at the cost of an additional storage of a parameters array.

This reduces the computation time (substantially), while convergence\r\nproperties are maintained. This paper is accompanied with the source code.",

     "content": "<P><b>Summary:</b>\r\n<P>This paper is a revised version of one submitted previously. It is the submission of classes to read and write MINC2 format files within the ITK pluggable factory framework.\r\n\r\n<P>This submission is significantly improved from the last version. I will incorporate this code in my code tree and begin using it regularly. Despite a few issues, I am confident enough to trust it on simple cases. However, I recommend a good code polishing and more extensive test suite.\r\n \r\n<P><b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\n<P>n/a\r\n\r\n<P><b>Evidence:</b>\r\n<P>A test which reads a minc2 file (provided), prints out a coordinate from it, and writes it out again is provided. There is no numerical testing of the result, it is presumed that the reader will view the output themselves. In fact, the provided file is rather anomalous, as its direction cosine vectors are not normalized - if you normalize them, then it seems that the directions are just along the regular axes anyway, so i am not entirely sure that this tests what it is supposed to. However, I tested it on a file where the direction cosines are normalized and not aligned with the coordinate axes and it works fine.\r\n\r\n<P><b>Open Science:</b>\r\n<P>Source code is provided. This work will, in effect, make two large bodies of open-source medical imaging software interoperable and so is very useful to open science.\r\n\r\n<P><b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\n<P>I downloaded and compiled the code. I did not actually test the CMakeLists, i just plugged the code into my own code tree where i had a place for it. \r\n\r\n<P>One edit was required to get it to compile under Visual C++7. There were some moderately serious problems with the MINC writing part. The code had some nasty access violations - I fixed the issues enough to get the test working, but i suspect the code may still need a little polishing. See code quality section below.\r\n\r\n<P><b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\n<P>The work makes ITK read the open-source minc data format. It is entirely open source.\r\n\r\n<P><b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\n<P>The work is open source. \r\n\r\n<P><b>Code Quality:</b>\r\n<P>There were some minor difficulties compiling this code on Windows. I also had some memory access violations on the write. I tweaked it and got it to work with the following changes. From the tweaking, my overall impression is that the code is good, but not yet perfect. \r\n\r\n<P>In particular, I would expect problems when facing files where the data is not scalar or the number of dimensions is not 3. \r\n\r\n<P>I suspect there are memory leaks in the code as well, some \\\\\\\"new\\\\\\\"s do not have corresponding deletes. See the first changes in the .cxx file below.\r\n\r\n<P>Here are my diffs to the code, interspersed with comments about why.\r\n\r\n<CODE>\r\n<BR>bash-3.00$ diff /cygdrive/c/temp/itkMINC2ImageIO.h ../src/IO/itkMINC2ImageIO.h\r\n<BR>132c132,133\r\n<BR>< int m_DimensionIndices[5];\r\n<BR>---\r\n<BR>> // int m_DimensionIndices[5];\r\n<BR>> int * m_DimensionIndices;\r\n</CODE>\r\n\r\n<P>I changed this while i was fixing the access violations. The declaration of DimensionIndices was inconsistent with the declaration of the other Dimension parameters.\r\n\r\n<CODE>\r\n<BR>bash-3.00$ diff /cygdrive/c/temp/itkMINC2ImageIO.cxx ../src/IO/itkMINC2ImageIO.cxx\r\n<BR>239a240\r\n<BR>> m_DimensionIndices = new int[MINC2_MAXDIM+1];\r\n</CODE>\r\n\r\n<P>This is to make the allocation of m_DimensionIndices compatible with the other dimension parameters. I didnt put in a corresponding delete, because i was not sure where to put it. Im not sure where the other dimension parameters are deallocated. so there is probably a memory leak.\r\n\r\n<CODE>\r\n<BR>241c242,243\r\n<BR>< for (int i = 0; i <= MINC2_MAXUSE; i++)\r\n<BR>---\r\n<BR>> // for (int i = 0; i <= MINC2_MAXUSE; i++)\r\n<BR>> for (int i = 0; i <= MINC2_MAXDIM; i++)\r\n</CODE>\r\n\r\n<P>Im not sure what the difference between MAXDIM and MAXUSE is. Further in the code, there is a loop over MAXDIM and the fact that m_DimensionName was not fully initialized caused problems.\r\n\r\n<CODE>\r\n<BR>610c612\r\n<BR>< buffer += Strides[1];\r\n<BR>---\r\n<BR>> //buffer += Strides[1];\r\n612c614,615\r\n<BR>< buffer += Strides[2];\r\n<BR>---\r\n<BR>> //buffer += Strides[2];\r\n<BR>> //std::cout<<\\\\\\\"max \\\\\\\"<<tmpmaxval<<\\\\\\\" min \\\\\\\"<<tmpminval<<std::endl;\r\n</CODE>\r\n\r\n<P>Originally there was an access violation in here. I had all kinds of problems with this function. Looking at Strides in the debugger, it doesnt look at all like i think it should and besides, if you increment buffer... why increment it by Strides again later. Anyway, i just made it increment by one each time through the loop, and all seems to work. But ultimately, i see why the author wants the more sophisticated approach - maybe this could be handled on the ITK end with an iterator?\r\n\r\n<CODE>\r\n<BR>1179c1182\r\n<BR>< unsigned long coords[m_NDims];\r\n<BR>---\r\n<BR>> unsigned long * coords=new(unsigned long[m_NDims]);\r\n</CODE>\r\n\r\n<P>This makes it compile on Windows. No, i did not put in the corresponding delete.\r\n\r\n<P><b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\n<P>MINC is widely used, so there are likely many projects that can make use of this work.\r\n\r\n<P><b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\n<P>Ultimately, it would be nice to have this completely integrated in the pluggable factory design for ITK. It simply involves including itkMINC2ImageIOFactory.h and adding the line\r\n<CODE>\r\n<P> ObjectFactoryBase::RegisterFactory( MINC2ImageIOFactory::New() ); \r\n</CODE>\r\nto the itkImageIOFactory.cxx file and should be done when this code is integrated.\r\n\r\n<P><b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\n<P>n/a\r\n\r\n<P><b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\n<P>When testing this code, I was confused at first because itk::Image does not support direction cosines at all, and one must use itk::OrientedImage to do so. This is done correctly in this project, and mentioned in comments in the test file, but it might be worth drawing the readers attention to it more specifically.\r\n\r\n<P>The paper does not follow the itkJournal typographical conventions.\r\n\r\n<P>The test file provided has direction cosines that do not have magnitude 1\r\n\r\n<P>Minor spelling and grammar issues:\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI><I>wed site</I> should be <I>web site</I>\r\n<LI><I>miset_real_value_hyperslsab</I> should be <I>miset_real_value_hyperslab</I>\r\n<LI><I>are copied into a temporary buffer one by one and send to</I> - should be <I>sent to</I>.\r\n</UL>\r\n",

For the computation of non-squared distances as well as signed distance maps, the authors utilize existing ITK algorithms on top of their own so they are following the paradigm of reusing as much existing code as possible.<br /><br /> <strong>Reproducibility:</strong><br />I did not ran the author&#39;s tests but tested the algorithm (extensively) in my own framework. The integration was done within minutes due to well written examples which are present within the publication.<br /><br /> <strong>Open Source Contributions:</strong><br />The algorithm implements the distance transform based on &quot;Distance Transforms of Sampled Functions.&quot; by Pedro F. Felzenszwalb and Daniel P. Huttenlocher which is new in the ITK framework.<br /><br /> <strong>Code Quality:</strong><br />All code is very well documented as well as very well structured and designed. A few abbreviations are used but they are already marked as to be replaced by the according long versions.</p><p> <strong>Applicability to other problems:</strong><br />Euclidean distance transforms are used in many applications/algorithms (registration, skeletonizing, etc.) and thus they are an important part within the ITK framework.</p><p>The work of the authors is probably of special interest to those who are computing distance transforms on &quot;large&quot; volumes, since it does not only have reasonable performance (~31s on 512x512x488, UseSpacing = true) but also a low memory print as opposed to the parallel maurer version introduced recently.</p><p><strong>Suggestions for future work:</strong> <br />Force the &#39;pow&#39; calls in the itkLowerEnvelopeOfParabolas.txx to float/double precision to prevent compile errors.</p><p>E.g. change </p><p>::minimalSpacing = static_cast&lt;SpacingType&gt;(pow(10, -MinimalSpacingPrecision));&nbsp;</p><p>to</p><p>::minimalSpacing = static_cast&lt;SpacingType&gt;(pow(10.0, -1.0*MinimalSpacingPrecision));</p><p><strong>Requests for additional information from authors:</strong><br />I&#39;ve stumbled over a small problem when I was reading binary unsigned short images from HD and wanted to perform a distance transform on them. I was wondering why the assert</p><p>assert(std::numeric_limits::is_signed);</p><p>was failing (itkLowerEnvelopeOfParabolas.txx l. 321). My input image was as said before unsigned short and my output image was float. After looking at the publication into section 3.1 at the description of the template parameters I found that you state that normally the TApexHeightType &quot;is the type of voxels in the distance image&quot;, i.e. TDistanceImage::PixelType.</p><p>This is now confusing me, since within the itk::GeneralizedDistanceTransformImageFilter the parameter is typedef&#39;ed to TFunctionImage::PixelType.</p><p>What is the correct version? I personally just did a quick-hack-test and interchanged TFunctionImage with TDistanceImage within the LEOP typedef but since I am not sure about the side effects I am not really happy with it, even though now I am getting correct distance transforms when enabling pixel spacing. </p><p> <strong>Additional Comments:</strong><br /> Great work and I am still giving full credit even in presence of the small issue mentioned above since the rest of the publication is so well done.&nbsp;</p>",

One of the strongest points of the algorithms described here is that they can be used for many other applications, because they are based on the ordered propagation paradigm. This idea consists in actually not raster scan the image but rather in start from the image objects and propagate them until the image is totally filled. This has been demonstrated to be a good approach in many algorithms as for example, computation of Distance Transforms, Voronoi Diagrams, Fast Marching, skeletons computation, etc. We show here that these algorithms have low computational complexity and it provides excellent results for clinical applications as the segmentation of brain MRI.",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThis paper describes the BioImage Suite, which is a collection of image analysis tools, including GUI-based and command-line programs, developed at Yale University.\r\n \r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nThe authors are releasing the bulk of the source code under the GPL license. One library cannot be released as open source due to licensing issues. A pre-release version (binary and source) is available from the web site, though it currently requires a user name and password (easy to obtain after registering).\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nI downloaded the Windows binary and installed it on Windows XP. I used the suggested root directory (C:\\\\Yale). The installation consisted of unzipping 4 ZIP files (not 3 as mentioned in the documentation). The program is starting by running a batch file. This was very easy to do and worked. I also downloaded the source code, but did not try to compile it myself.\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nThe paper mentions that BioImage Suite uses VTK, ITK, and TCL/TK (with extensions such as IWidgets). In addition, by reviewing the downloaded files, it is clear that it also uses other open source packages such as Xerces, MINC, and CLAPACK.\r\n\r\nThe project uses the CMake and Subversion open source tools.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nThis is a significant amount of software that is being made available to the research community. The authors are working to replace some of the closed source libraries. The authors provide binary versions for many different operating systems.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nI downloaded, but did not review, the source code. The design of the web site is very good and appears to have ample documentation.\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nThere are a lot of image analysis tools, which should be applicable to a wide range of medical applications.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nThe authors state that they make extensive use of VMWare for testing the software on different operating systems, but do not describe the testing framework. For a software package of this size, I would strongly urge the developers to create an automated testing framework (e.g., using Dart), if they have not already done so.\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\nThe authors mention similar open source packages, such as Slicer, Brainsuite, and SPM, but do not offer a comparison to BioImage Suite. Given that they recently received an NIH grant for \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontinued development and maintenance\u00e2\u0080\u009d, I assume that they must have already described (at least in the proposal) the new features that their package could offer.\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\nI find the GUI to be less \u00e2\u0080\u009csexy\u00e2\u0080\u009d than the 3D Slicer package (though I am more familiar with 3D Slicer). The availability of command line tools is a nice feature in BioImage Suite and the generation of Makefiles to manage the batch processing is a good idea.\r\n\r\nThe VVLink capability is interesting (I also read the ISBI06 paper available on the website). \r\n\r\n\r\n",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThe authors provide an \\\"update\\\" to their current efforts in developing the BioImage Suite. The BioImage Suite fully utilizes several readily available software packages to provide a \\\"user-friendly user interface\\\" for medical image analysis. The paper describes the various algorithms in the package as well as some of the biomedical applications have been developed with the suite. The discussion includes a description of licensing and availability.\r\n\r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nAs the paper title suggests, this is suppose to be an \\\"update\\\" to the previous paper. The evidence should be in the \\\"updating\\\" of the textual description of the package. While I think that the suite is both interesting and potentially useful, I found the paper to be lacking a bit. I found much the the text to be the same (almost word for word) with the previous submissions which the authors are updating.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nThe package will be open-source (and available under the GPL) soon. The package can be downloaded now following registration. The authors note that there is one library which is closed. The issue becomes whether this hinder the open-science movement to build upon their success. As the authors point out, the single library is a small component and their hands are tied due to other licensing. However, even with the restrictions (by third-parties), the authors still have the right to publish the methods included within the code. (See next section)\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nSince the package will be largely open source, reproducibility should be straightforward (although that is only a best guess as I have not reviewed the source). With regards to the single closed library, the authors will not be able to provide source code, but they should be publishing (in great detail) the methods within the library as that is not restricted. As such, anyone who has a valid licence of numerical recipes (which many do) can recreate the functionality. In the same manner, anyone with the appropriate Vector Vision Link licence should be able to write the appropriate connection code.\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nThe authors take full advantage of open source software from the programming languages used (tcl/tk) to the graphics drivers (mesa), when needed. The exciting aspect of this work is the combination of all of these tools into a useful package. As already noted, there are some minor restrictions with the Vector Vision Link software and the Numerical Recipes software.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nI do not have the source code. It was not included with submission. The website has a mechanism to get the software.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nDitto\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nThis suite has great application to many different clinical problems. I look forward to exploring its potential.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nIf not available, I suggest that the authors post or publish the methods within the closed library so others can properly reproduce the work.\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\n\r\n",

     "content": " <b>Summary:</b>\r\n\r\n<!-- Short description of the paper. In two or three phrases describe the\r\nproblem that was addressed by the authors and the approach they took to\r\nsolve it. -->\r\n\r\nThis paper describes <b>BioImage Suite</b>, an software package for medical\r\nimage analysis. It is has been used in a wide variety of applications,\r\nincluding fMRI, DTI, and segmentation. The aim is to provide easy-to-use\r\ntools, with a strong clinical application focus.\r\n\r\nThe BioImage Suite is in a similar solution space to Slicer, Brainsuite and\r\nAnalyse. It comprises a GUI and a series of command-line tools for batch\r\nprocessing, and has been developed internally at Yale over the past 10\r\nyears, being used on a variety of projects.\r\n\r\nThis paper is an updated version of a\r\n<a href=\\\\\\\"http://hdl.handle.net/1926/37\\\\\\\">previous submission which described the\r\nBioImage Suite</a>, and the authors have fulfilled their promise to publish\r\nthe source of the package. The content of the paper itself appears to be\r\nvirtually the same as to last years\\\\\\' submission, with some changes to reflect the\r\nbeta release of the source code.\r\n\r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\n\r\n<!-- If Applicable: Describe the assumptions that the authors have made and\r\nthey hypothesis of their work, note that not all papers will fit the model\r\nof hypothesis driven work, for example, the description of an image\r\ndatabase, or the description of a toolkit will not be driven by an\r\nhypothesis, in which case, please simply write : Non Applicable in this\r\nfield or delete the subtitle. -->\r\n\r\nThat the BioImage Suite can support clinical image analysis applications,\r\nand that it is user-friendly and well-documented.\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the evidence that the authors provide in order to support\r\ntheir claims in the paper. This is a key component on Open Science, opinions\r\nthat are not supported by evidence should be labeled as speculations or\r\nauthors opinion while. The same rule applies to the text of the reviews:\r\nclaims should be supported by evidence -->\r\n\r\nThe project website includes quite a comprehensive set of\r\n<a href=\\\\\\\"http://www.bioimagesuite.org/public/Intro.html\\\\\\\">online\r\ndocumentation</a>, which describes how to use the various components of the\r\nsystem in some detail, including screenshots and tutorial-style information.\r\nThe system appears to be reasonably user-friendly, based on studying the\r\navailable screenshots.\r\n\r\nWhile the system has obviously seen considerable use and wide application\r\nover the years, the paper did not discuss clinical applications or present a\r\ncase-study.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how much the paper and its addendums adhere to the concept of\r\nOpen Science. Do the authors provide the source code of the programs used in\r\ntheir experiments? Do the authors provide the input images that they used?\r\nOr are those images publicly available? Do the authors provide the output\r\nimages that they show in the paper? Do the authors provide enough details\r\nfor you to be able to replicate their work? -->\r\n\r\nThe authors provide access to the full source code (and nearly all the\r\ndependent libraries). The paper shows examples and screenshots of the\r\napplication running. The binary distribution also includes some example\r\nimage data.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\n\r\n<!-- Did you reproduce the authors work? Did you download their code? Did\r\nyou compile it? Did you run it? Did you managed to get the same results\r\nthat they reported? Were there information missing from the paper, that was\r\nnecessary for you to reproduce the work? Suggest improvements that will make\r\neasier for future readers to reproduce this work. -->\r\n\r\nI followed the instrucions on the project website to obtain the software.\r\nThis involved a quick registration process, and was then able to download\r\nthe software. I obtained the latest source\r\n(<tt>bioimagesuite_1.995_src_507.zip</tt> dated 24th August 2006) as well as\r\nthe pre-built binaries for Linux.\r\n\r\nI was unable to completely build the software from source on my machine\r\n(Debian GNU/Linux Etch, i586). While I do have LAPACK, BLAS, ATLAS and all\r\nsuch packages installed (including clapack.h), I do not have\r\nCLAPACKConfig.cmake and could find no reference via Google. I managed to\r\nhack past this problem, only to encounter other difficulties which prevented\r\nfurther progress.\r\n\r\nI untarred them into a private directory, adjusted the path settings\r\naccording to the documentation. (The install documentation says that\r\nuntarring will result in three directories, but it omits mention of the\r\n<tt>bioimage_extra</tt> directory.) The system assumes that the software is\r\ninstalled under <tt>/usr/local</tt>, which was not an option in this\r\ninstance. While the scripts to run BioImage have a BASE directory, it is\r\nnot used by the scripts, and changing the paths is most cumbersome.\r\n\r\nSome issues: the <tt>bioimagesuite/setpaths.sh</tt> script refers to FSL,\r\nwhich is not included. The <tt>setextra.sh</tt> script refers to minc20,\r\nwhich is under the extra directory but the script assumes it is under the\r\nbase directory. The configuration tries to set TCL_LIB_PATH, but the\r\ncorrect environment variable (according to the documentation I consulted)\r\nspecifies TCLLIBPATH, ie. without the underscores). Also, since this\r\npackage is distributing its own copy of Tcl, the TCL_LIBRARY environment\r\nvariable needs to be set to the base path of <tt>init.tcl</tt>.\r\n\r\nWith my custom script (see below) I was able to successfully run the suite.\r\nI loaded some test data (<tt>mni_305.hdr</tt>), and carried out some common\r\ntasks: preprocessing, bias-field correction, smoothing, histogram\r\nsegmentation, morphology and others. I was able to perform these common\r\noperations without needing to refer to the documentation, supporting the\r\nease of use claim.\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\n\r\n<!-- Did the authors use Open Source software in their work? Do they\r\ndescribe their experience with it, advantages and disadvantages? Do they\r\nprovide advice for future users of those Open Source packages? -->\r\n\r\nThe BioImage Suite makes extensive use of existing FLOSS projects, including\r\nITK, VTK, LAPACK, Mesa 3D, Tcl/Tk, IWidget, and Metakit. It leverages these\r\nlibraries to provide a high-level interface. (It also appears to include\r\nthe HDF5 package, which doesn\\\\\\'t seem to be mentioned in the documentation.)\r\nThe paper does not discuss in any detail how these libraries were used.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\n\r\n<!-- Do the authors provide their source code? Is it in a form that is\r\nusable? Do they describe clearly how to use of the code? How long did it\r\ntake you to use that code? -->\r\n\r\nThe complete source code is made available on the BioImage website, which is\r\navailable after a brief registration step. The source comprises some\r\n300,000 lines of source files, representing a very significant contribution\r\nto the community.\r\n\r\nThis website also features user forums, encompassing support, discussion on\r\nfMRI, DTI, integrating with other software, news and discussion.\r\nseveral relevant papers and resources are provided, including tutorials\r\nand user manual.\r\n\r\nAs the project is making the transition from an internal project to its\r\nfirst public release, various environmental issues have become apparent, as\r\nnoted above. This is due to the inevitable dependencies and assumptions\r\nthat one is able to make in a controlled or homogeneous environment, such as\r\nthe presence of dependent libraries or tools, and the locations and paths of\r\ncomponents, and so on. As the project progresses in its new public phase,\r\nthese issues will surely be ironed out and the project should become more\r\neasily deployable on external systems.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\n\r\n<!-- If the authors provided their source code: Was the code easy to read?\r\nDid they use a modern coding style? Did they rely on non-portable mechanism?\r\nWas it suitable for multiple-platforms? -->\r\n\r\nThe code is broken up into sensible modules (such as GUI, Imaging, and so\r\non). The layout of the source code is generally readable and consistent,\r\nbut often uses extremely long lines (>80 characters). Most classes have\r\nsmall, cohesive methods. The class interfaces seem to be generally\r\nwell-defined. There is still a certain amount of debug code, such as\r\n<tt>cout</tt> and <tt>printf</tt> calls sprinkled about (while others use\r\nthe VTK debug macros). There are quite a few instances of literal constants\r\nand magic numbers, such as IDs for menu items which must be the same between\r\nmodules, or processing modes, colour constants, lookup tables, etc. The\r\ncoding conventions are fairly similar to the ITK conventions (making the\r\ntransition of contributions easier to manage). (A few dozen source files\r\nwere chosen semi-randomly across the various directories in the\r\nsource code for inspection.)\r\n\r\nThere is very little documentation within the code. Using a tool such as\r\nDoxygen and providing inline documentation of classes and methods would\r\nimprove the maintainability of the code, and enable external developers to\r\nget up to speed and contribute and enhance the code base.\r\n\r\nThe code is generally designed for portability, as evidenced by the fact\r\nthat it runs on Windows, Linux, Solaris and Mac OS X. This is obviously in\r\nno small part thanks to the portability of the underlying libraries, however\r\nthe authors have gone to great lengths to not only support the major\r\nplatforms in their own code, but to provide pre-built binaries for each\r\nalso.\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\n\r\n<!-- Do you find that the authors methods can be applied to other image\r\nanalysis problems? Suggest other disciplines or even other specific projects\r\nthat could take advantage of this work -->\r\n\r\nThe suite includes implementations of several useful algorithms, which would\r\nbe very useful in their own right. Some of these may be appropriate to make\r\nas contributions to the ITK or VTK core. While the suite contains tools for\r\nspecific applications such as angiography, it provides general segmentation\r\nand registration tools, which may be equally used in other areas such as\r\nthoracic imaging or brain sementation.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\n\r\n<!-- Suggest to authors future directions for improving their methods, or\r\nother domains from which they could learn technique that could help them\r\nadvance in their research. -->\r\n\r\n<i>Building</i>\r\n\r\nMaking the codebase easier to build on different systems is the biggest\r\nhurdle to adoption by external developers, and to a lesser extent users.\r\nThe paths configuration could be streamlined, to make it easier to install\r\nin a custom root (for example, <tt>/opt/bioimage</tt>).\r\n\r\n<i>Distribution</i>\r\n\r\nThe binary distributions are broken up into four differnent tarballs for\r\ndownload. Since they are all required, and are built to be run together, it\r\nwould be helpful to have a single tarball to download all the required\r\nbinaries.\r\n\r\n<i>Documentation</i>\r\n\r\nThe system currently has minimal developer documentation. Information such\r\nas the build and runtime dependencies, minimum versions of packages required\r\n(eg. CLAPACK/LAPACK), CMake, and so on would be very useful. Since the\r\nsystem provides much code that could be re-used elsewhere, providing an API\r\nreference (much like ITK does with the doxygen-generated docs) would be\r\nextremely valuable.\r\n\r\n<i>Startup Scripts</i>\r\n\r\nThe scripts included assume the system is installed in <tt>/usr/local</tt>,\r\nand are difficult and tedious to update.\r\n\r\nDue to the difficulty of changing all the paths in all the startup scripts,\r\nI wrote a single script that sets all the paths at once, which are all\r\nrelative to a single base directory. This avoids the problems of requiring\r\nBioImage Suite be installed in <tt>/usr/local</tt>, and makes it easier to\r\nconfigure and customize, since it is all relative to one single base\r\ndirectory variable. The script is below:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n#!/bin/sh\r\n\r\nBASE=`pwd`\r\nITK_DIR=$BASE/itk241_yale\r\nVTK_DIR=$BASE/vtk44_yale\r\nEXTRA_DIR=$BASE/bioimagesuite_extra\r\nBIS_DIR=$BASE/bioimagesuite\r\n\r\nMAIN_DIR=${BIS_DIR}/main\r\nBIN_DIR=${BIS_DIR}/bin\r\nAPPS_DIR=${BIS_DIR}/apps\r\nMJACK_DIR=${BIS_DIR}/mjack\r\nVTKNR_DIR=${BIS_DIR}/vtknr\r\nDATATREE_DIR=${BIS_DIR}/datatree\r\n\r\nPATH=$BIS_DIR/bin:$EXTRA_DIR/bin:$VTK_DIR/bin:$BIN_DIR:$MAIN_DIR:$APPS_DIR:$MJACK_DIR:$VTKNR_DIR:$DATATREE_DIR:$PATH\r\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ITK_DIR/lib/InsightToolkit:$VTK_DIR/lib:$VTK_DIR/lib/vtk:$EXTRA_DIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\r\n\r\nexport PATH\r\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH\r\n\r\nTCL_LIBRARY=$VTK_DIR/lib/tcl8.4\r\nTK_LIBRARY=$VTK_DIR/lib/tk8.4\r\nTCLLIBPATH=$VTK_DIR/lib/tcllib1.8\r\n\r\nexport TCL_LIBRARY\r\nexport TK_LIBRARY\r\nexport TCLLIBPATH\r\n\r\npxmenu.tcl\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\n\r\n<!-- Did you find that information was missing from the paper? Maybe\r\nparameters for running the tests? Maybe some images were missing? Would you\r\nlike to get more details on how the diagrams, or plots were generated? -->\r\n\r\nIt would be very interesting to have not just an overview of the system, but\r\na discussion of the design of the package. How do the components fit\r\ntogether? How did they design the architecture, with its blend of C++ and\r\nTcl code? How can some of the core algorithms be reused in other projects?\r\n\r\nCross-platform development is very important, and the developers seem to\r\nhave an interesting approach involving VMWare Server. A discussion of their\r\napproach, for building, testing, deployment, etc would also be of interest\r\nto many developers.\r\n\r\nGiven the fact that the BioImage Suite has apparently been in widespread use\r\nwithin Yale for many years, it would have been most useful to present some\r\ncase studies to show how it is being used, what benefits it confers to the\r\nusers, and how it is employed in clinical diagnosis and interventions. The\r\ncore of the paper is a general overview of the features of the system, and\r\ndoesn\\\\\\'t provide much detail on how the code was implemented.\r\n\r\nOf particular interest to many members of the community would be a\r\ndiscussion of how the system interfaces to the Brainlab IGS system (a\r\nsuggestion from a reviewer in last year\\\\\\'s submission). Of course, the\r\npublication of this module\\\\\\'s source would be very useful.\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\n\r\n<!-- This is a free-form field -->\r\n\r\nThe suite is built upon a large number of other libraries, most of which\r\nappear to be published under a BSD-style license. The authors are\r\npublishing this suite under the GPL, which has implications on the other\r\nlibraries whose source is distributed alongside. It is not a foregone\r\nconclusion that all these licenses are GPL-compatible, and some legal advice\r\nmay be appropriate to ensure no terms are being bent. It is somewhat of a\r\nconcern that the authors state in the paper that a core library will remain\r\nproprietary, as this is obviously not compatible with the GPL (depending on\r\nthe linkage between the module and the rest of the system).\r\n\r\nThe Numerical Recipes code is obviously proprietary and will remain so,\r\nfree/open alternatives to a significant number of these algorithms are available\r\nelsewhere (eg. GSL, etc) which may overcome this particular limitation,\r\nso it should be possible to replace this with code and free the affected module.\r\n\r\nSince the authors use VMWare extensively for their multi-platform\r\ndevelopment, perhaps they would consider providing a\r\n<a href=\\\\\\\"http://www.vmware.com/vmtn/appliances/\\\\\\\">\r\nVirtual Server Appliance</a> with BioImage Suite ready to run. This would\r\nenable people to try the software after a single download, and would avoid\r\npotential compatability issues with DLLs, configuring paths, and so on.\r\n\r\n<b>Conclusion</b>\r\n\r\nIn summary, the project includes full source code, documentation and sample\r\ndata. The suite clearly addresses the need to have productive tools and\r\ninterfaces for working with medical image data. The paper provides a good\r\noverview of the suite, but leaves the reader wanting to know more detail\r\nabout how it was designed and how it is being used in practice. This suite\r\nis of general and broad interest, for researchers to analyse and explore\r\nimage data. This package should prove very popular and useful for a wide\r\nvariety of users, and anyone interested should download it to evaluate it\r\nfor their application.\r\n",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThis paper describes the Slicer Image Guided Navigator (SIGN) software being developed at BWH. It adds support for imaging and tracking systems to 3D Slicer (it seems), using the GIHI and OpenTracker open source libraries, respectively.\r\n \r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nThe paper promises to adhere to the principles of open science, although the primary source code will not be available until October 19.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nThe SIGN source code is not available for download. I downloaded the GIHI source code (SVN repository) but did not compile it. I tried to find OpenTracker V1.3 but it is not available from the specified web site, which lists V1.1.1 as the latest version. There is a note to contact the project administrator to get a developers version from SVN. I did not do this. Some of the documentation refers to OpenTracker V1.2 and later, so clearly the repository must contain more recent versions.\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nThe SIGN projects uses a lot of open source software, including VTK, KWWIDGETS, ITK, OpenTracker, GIHI, XERCES, and ACE. It also uses the SPLOT package (extensions to OpenTracker), which I assume will be available as open source software. The relationship to 3D Slicer is not entirely clear. The paper states that the SIGN is designed to be \u00e2\u0080\u009chighly interoperable\u00e2\u0080\u009d with 3D Slicer. Can the SIGN run without Slicer? If so, it seems it would duplicate some of the functionality of Slicer. If not, Slicer should be added to the list of open source software.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nThe paper states that The SIGN will be released as open source on Oct 19. It also says that information will be given at www.ncigt.org. I only found a brief reference to the SIGN under the \u00e2\u0080\u009c3D Slicer Engineering\u00e2\u0080\u009d project.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nI looked at the GIHI source code, which is written in C for portability to older platforms. It is supported on Linux and Solaris at this time. The code quality seems fine, though one cannot call it \\\\\\\"modern\\\\\\\". Note, however, that The SIGN source code, which is the primary subject of this paper, may not have any similarities to GIHI.\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nThe SIGN is an application framework and is therefore applicable to a large number of problems. 3D Slicer has been successfully applied to a number of applications, and it is reasonable to expect the SIGN (which seems to add intraoperative imaging and tracking support to 3D Slicer) to also be widely applicable.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nObviously, finish the software and make it available as open source! Also, improve the operating system support (e.g., some components, such as GIHI, are limited at this time -- just Linux and Solaris).\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\nThis paper presents a clear overview, but is short on technical details. Section 2.3 is especially brief and refers to (11) for comprehensive details. There actually is no reference 11 (maybe this should be 10?). I would have liked to see some explanation of the dynamic data structures. \r\n\r\nSome block diagrams, flowcharts, etc. describing the software would be a welcome addition. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\n\r\nFollowing are some minor typos:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Section 2.3 (noted above) and 2.4 refer to (11), but there is no reference with this number.</li>\r\n<li>The Medscan description says \u00e2\u0080\u009cin order to encoding all services\u00e2\u0080\u009d, which should be \u00e2\u0080\u009cin order to encode all services\u00e2\u0080\u009d.</li>\r\n<li>The section numbering seems to be off.

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThe paper demonstrated a new software framework (named \u00e2\u0080\u009cSlicer Image-Guided Navigator\u00e2\u0080\u009d or SIGN) for Image-Guided Therapy that aims to provide real-time intraoperative surgical navigation with dynamic visualization and interactions with multiple imaging and tracking devices, through a seamless integration of dynamic data structures (medical reality modeling language, or MRML). The software package was developed based on various open-source frameworks and will itself be open-source soon to be available to the public.\r\n \r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nThe authors argue that newly emerging image-guided procedures and therapies have seen increasing use of multiple imaging modalities and tracking devices at the same time in the OR. I agree that new surgical navigation applications are therefore desired to seamlessly interact with different imaging and tracking systems through a virtually transparent interface (to the users) with significant portability and expendability. In addition, more and stricter regulatory requirements pose new challenges on academic software development for research tools in clinical treatments. \r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nSeveral clinical-relevant applications were presented using the current development of SIGN. The software framework was itself very well established and clearly presented through detailed designs of various system components that handle different hardware and software interfacings (i.e. GIHI for the imager interfacing, OpenTracker for the tracker interfacing, and Hybrid for event and data handling). References to the open-source resources used were also adequately provided.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nI think the proposed software framework is clearly designed with open-source development and distribution in mind. According to the paper, SIGN was developed primarily based on the open-source 3D Slicer framework and has extensively employed many other open-source frameworks (e.g., OpenTracker, GIHI, VTK, ITK, etc.) to develop its major system components (e.g., MedScan). The authors have also promised the release of SIGN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original source codes on October 19th, 2006 to the open-source community. So it is evident to me that the proposed software framework will eventually benefit the public by contributing to the open-source community. \r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nSince the source codes of SIGN will not be made available to general public until October 19th, 2006, I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been able to reproduce the authors work as described in this paper. However, I was able to download and install the OpenTracker package from the link provided by the paper. I should point out that there is one small mistake in the paper regarding the latest version of OpenTracker (the paper mentioned that the latest version is v1.3, while on OpenTracker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website, it states that v1.1.1 is its latest release). For GIHI, I kept getting a \u00e2\u0080\u009cconnection timeout\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the link suggested by the paper, so I have not been able to test it during the writing of this review. \r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nAn extensive use of the existing open-source software is evident in the development of SIGN. The framework was developed primarily based on the open-source 3D Slicer framework and has employed many other open-source frameworks (including OpenTracker, GIHI, VTK, ITK, KWWidgets, Xerces and Aceto) to develop its major system components.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nThe authors have promised the release of SIGN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original source codes on October 19th, 2006 to the open-source community. No test is possible until then.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nThe authors have promised the release of SIGN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original source codes on October 19th, 2006 to the open-source community. No examination of the code quality is possible until then.\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nMy understanding of the major strength of SIGN is in its ability to interface multiple imaging and tracking devices with seamless dynamic data integration and visualization. This framework could be extended to various existing image-guided surgical navigation systems that employ a broad range of imaging (e.g., CT, MRI, and US) and tracking (e.g., optical or magnetic) systems. In addition, the dynamic data encapsulation of SIGN (using MRML) may be applicable to many data management applications (not limited to medical applications) that wish to easily share, convert, and transfer data between different formats.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nWas there a high-level design approach employed to outline the interrelationship between all the interfacing components in SIGN? Event handling for hybrid devices (devices of all kinds) in a generic interface is very attractive to many software engineering applications, but in general remains extremely complicated (essentially each device has its own protocol for communications). So in the future design of SIGN (and its extensions), a high-level design approach (e.g., Rational Rose or generic UML) is very helpful here to sort out all relationships between multiple system components at different interacting levels.\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\nPlease see the following additional comments.\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\n1. In imaging hardware (Section 1.1), ultrasound (US) was not mentioned here as newly emerging imaging modalities. However, later on in the following sections, US was indicated apparently as one of the imagers in SIGN. \r\n\r\n2. In tracking devices (Section 1.2), the authors illustrate many types of tracking systems including their advantages and disadvantages. However, no single reference was given here. More references are necessary here.\r\n\r\n3. AMIGO (Section 1.4) was described as the context of the proposed framework (the ultimate application), however, there was no a word or two later in the paper briefing how, in a larger picture, SIGN is (or will be) adopted in AMIGO. Please provide a brief explanation of this link somewhere after SIGN is introduced.\r\n\r\n4. GIHI was written in C. Shouldn\\\\\\'t it consider using C++? Or at least a combination of C (for portability) and C++ (expandability)? Seems to me that GIHI requires many service/component extensions, either current or in the future. C is indeed portable and efficient but fairly poor at expandability, especially for a large system like SIGN that has multiple software components. \r\n\r\n5. Was there a specific design software used to design the overall structure of SIGN and its interactions with other system components (like OpenTracker and GIHI)? SIGN seems to be a very large, complicated, and distributed (multiple components acting in an asynchronous fashion) system employing a great amount of events and their handlers. It seems (at least to me) virtually impossible to design such a dynamic system efficiently and completely without the assistance of some professional design approaches (e.g, Rational Rose). \r\n\r\n6. In hybrid interfacing (Section 2.3), from a system-design point of view, why Terason is designed as a separate module that is parallel to MedScan? At a high level in the overall system, shouldn\\\\\\'t Terason be part of the GIHI library whose primary duty is to handle the interfacing with various imaging devices (which include US)? Please clarify.\r\n\r\n7. In the illustration of SIGN (Section 2.4 the last paragraph), I was a bit confused here: the tracker is presumably a monitoring device that traces the motion of the objects in real time. It is supposed to be a passive observer. So what does it mean that once connected to the data object in MRML tree, the tracker could move an object around the scene? Or maybe it was my incorrect interpretation? Please clarify a bit here.\r\n\r\n8. In the introduction of SIGN (Section 2.4), the authors claimed that \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe framework was designed to be highly interoperable with the 3D Slicer \u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d. However, the exact relationship between SIGN and 3D Slicer still remains unclear to me even after reading through the entire paper. Was SIGN designed and developed primarily based on the 3D Slicer framework? Or they simply just share the same data structure protocol (using MRML)? Please clarify the term \u00e2\u0080\u009cinteroperable\u00e2\u0080\u009d in more details here.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nAuthors presents a software framework whose purpose is to develop specific image-guided applications using multiple intra-operative imaging. The framework is based upon an extended open-source interfacing of the open-source OPenTracker library and an imager hardware interface GIHI, using 4 separate new modules. The framework was implemented to support multiple system interactions and visualization tasks, with a dynamic execution model. \r\n \r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nThere is a need in image-guided therapy for software framework satisfying the following requirements: using multiple imaging instruments with proper functionality, portability, abstraction and speed. The fact of tracking multiple tools or getting multiple images at the same time in real-time is of course of great interest for image-guided surgery, in particular for augmented reality or augmented virtuality. \r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nThe demonstration of the interest was based on the presentation of 5 clinical applications. However, the code is not yet available, it will be on the 19th of October. I was then not able to reproduce the presented results. The need of a framework allowing aplication as separate silos was justified by the regulatory requirements.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nThe presented framework is is the spirit of open science, for 2 reasons: 1) it is based upon existing open-source libraries, and extended or interfaced them 2) The source code of the programs used in their experiments was not provided yet but it will be open source. It consists on an add-on to an existing open source library Open tracker and to a global framework library, the SIGN, interfacing other opens ource librairies.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nNot available since no code was not provided\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nThe framework The SIGN is based upon (instead of duplicating) existing open-source efforts, as OpenTracker, VTK, KWWidgets, ITK, SPLOT , GIHI, Xerces and Ace. \r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nNo code available. I was not able to compile the GIHI part, and the openTracker v1.3 is not available directly on the indicated link.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nThe developments was made in C, said to respect portability rules. But the code is not available. Nothing said about dart test or others.\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nThe authors have shown the applicability to a large range of problem, by showin 5 different applications. The replay posibilities could be really interesting for pedagogical purposes, or to make some e-books for surgeon. \r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\n It will be of interest in the future first release to have the demonstrations application code, and an image simulator, or at least the replay. Moreover you could include to your software an aplication validation strategy, which could lead to both performance evaluation and validation of each developped application using the software. Most of time when developping an application using intraoperative imaging, you have not a wide access to the intraoperative imaging. Including simulators of different kind (for tools, images, etc...) is really important for rapid prototyping. \r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\nThe relation with the AMIGO operating room was not clear, since it was no more mentionned after its presentation. Figures are of interest for demonstrations of the workflow interest, I would like to have them bigger and with a detailed description. What is the black window in figure 4? It would be of interest to underline the differences with other available Image-guided surgery toolkits, as <A HREF=\\\\\\\"http://www.igstk.org/index.htm\\\\\\\">IGSTK</A>. What is reference (11)? Reference (9) and (10) are not cited in the text. \r\nCould you add a reference for MRML?\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\nThe note was given following the reviewer\\\\\\'s guideline: detail of note: 1/2 Code not available but built upon open-source libraries+1/1 adress a real software-based need within the community+ 0.5/1 No material provided but concepts are well described + 1/1 all research projects in image-guided surgery would benefit of this work .

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThe abundance of imaging devices, tracking devices and other electronic devices which image guided therapy relies on has resulted in many efforts to develop sofware frameworks which abstracts the inherent complexity of integrating such devices in image guided therapy software applications. Important requirements of such frameworks are portability, usability, synchronization, flexibility and speed. The authors describe a new framework which aims at supporting all of these requirements. Three main software components constitute the software framework. OpenTracker is a general data streaming components which can interface to such datasources as tracking devices, ECG devices and imaging sources. Another component handles interfacing to imaging hardware, GIHI, which can be used to extract tracking data from imaging devices where that is relevant, extract images in addition to provide a interface for controlling imaging parameters. The last component is VTK which is used for visualization purposes. XML is used to configure the framework and can be set up such that data can flow between the components in an almost seamless manner.\r\n \r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nNot applicable.\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nA number of clinical examples are presented in the paper. However, the only example which is backed up by a reference to show its clinical relevance is the endoscopic navigation. \r\nI don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t really see how ITK is integrated in this framework.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nMost of the source code is currently available such as OpenTracker and GIHI. The rest of the source code is set to be released in October. However, most of the source code which is due to be released are the parts which provides the interfaces between the various components. However, I didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t quite understand whether the source code for the examples also will be released?\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nNot applicable since the source code is not publicly available.\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nI don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t know. There is no section which discusses the licenses of the software components.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nThe framework should be applicable to many image guided applications due to its flexible nature.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nI would definitely like to see how ITK is integrated in the framework. A seamless integration of ITK, or other image processing libraries, into image guided therapy frameworks is something I still haven\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t witnessed.\r\n\r\nThe paper doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t discuss the advantages/disadvantages of The SIGN compared to other image guided therapy frameworks such as IGSTK, Julius etc.\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\nI\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m looking to following the further development of the framework as it has many good things going for it. In particular, the interface to the popular slicer, VTK and ITK in addition to the novel hybrid data flow component.\r\n",

The software package contains a programming library (C++ language) and an MDI user interface (kernel). The major interest is to allow the creation of fully modular applications. Both user processing functions and image read/write facilities are separately compiled as DLLs, and the resulting plugin objects are dynamically imported into the kernel. The library provides all the required wrapping material to incorporate all find of image processing functions into user-written components. A rapid prototyping application is provided to communicate with the kernel communication interface. No graphics programming skills is required to manage advanced user interactions, image display (e.g. OpenGL), and generic image processing functions based on C++ templates. The component-oriented software architecture makes it possible to share image processing and handling resources for light Windows processing applications.",

The application includes basic image manipluation tools and the plug-in interface allows for including custom processing algorithms. The text describes both the application and the plug-in interface. The paper concludes by stating \\\"Neither the library code nor processing plug-in are publicly available on the website for now, but it remains possible to obtain some of them by contacting the authors.\\\"\r\n \r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nN/A. This is a straightforward description of the application and plug-in interface at a high level.\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nN/A. I suppose that the evidence is the application that is included with the submission.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nThis really doesn\\'t fit the open science model. The methods described are proprietary to the Borland compiler and the code is not available. However, the interface between the application and plug-ins is open, therefore, allowing users of the package to build custom, open plug-ins. Indeed, this model is exactly the same used by Kitware for VolView. The plug-in architecture is open, so that some aspects of the work could be published openly much like ITK plugs into VolView. Nonetheless, one might be concerned about how the application could manipulate the data before and after the application calls the plug-in. This aspect of the work could not be evaluated openly.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nThere is no discussion of (or implication of) the use of open source software.

   "abstract": "Shape analysis has become of increasing interest to\nthe neuroimaging community due to its potential to precisely locate\nmorphological changes between healthy and pathological structures.\nThis manuscript presents a comprehensive set of tools for the computation of 3D structural statistical shape analysis. It has been applied in several studies on brain morphometry, but can potentially be employed in other 3D shape problems. Its main limitations is the necessity of spherical topology. \n\nThe input of the proposed shape analysis is a set of binary segmentation of a single brain structure, such as the hippocampus or caudate. These segmentations are converted into a corresponding spherical harmonic description (SPHARM), which is then sampled into a triangulated surfaces (SPHARM-PDM). After alignment, differences between groups of surfaces are computed using the Hotelling $T^2$ two sample metric. Statistical p-values, both raw and corrected for multiple comparisons, result in significance maps. Additional visualization of the group tests are provided via mean difference magnitude and vector maps, as well as maps of the group covariance information.\n\nThe correction for multiple comparisons is performed via two separate methods that each have a distinct view of the problem. The first one aims to control the family-wise error rate (FWER) or false-positives via the extrema histogram of non-parametric permutations. The second method controls the false discovery rate and results in a less conservative estimate of the false-negatives.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nitrc.org/projects/spharm-pdm\"> New NITRC page for binary distribution </a>\n ",

   "abstract": "The gestational age (GA) determination is one of the most used measures to guide diagnostics of specialists in neonatology to\r\nguarantee the newborn surveillance. However, the currently available methods have been subject to a number of evaluations and criticism by important medical publications concerning both their low precision and their invasive procedures. Based on this scenario, the FootScanAge method was conceived, seeking to determine the GA through digital imaging of the newborn plantar surface. To support the evaluation and evolution of this new method, it was developed an Open Source and Java based Decision Support System that combines Data Mining and Image Processing techniques to implement the FootScanAge method. The system was developed taking advantage of high degree of interaction between experts in neonatology and computer science.",

   "abstract": "Image fusion provides a mechanism to combine multiple images into a single representation to aid human visual perception and image processing tasks. Such algorithms endeavour to create a fused image containing the salient information from each source image, without introducing artefacts or inconsistencies. Image fusion is applicable for numerous fields including: defence systems, remote sensing and geoscience, robotics and industrial engineering, and medical imaging. In the medical imaging domain, image fusion may aid diagnosis and surgical planning tasks requiring the segmentation, feature extraction, and/or visualisation of multi-modal datasets.\r\n\r\nThis paper discusses the implementation of an image fusion toolkit built upon the Insight Toolkit (ITK). Based on an existing architecture, the proposed framework (GIFT) offers a 'plug-and-play' environment for the construction of n-D multi-scale image fusion methods. We give a brief overview of the toolkit design and demonstrate how to construct image fusion algorithms from low-level components (such as multi-scale methods and feature generators). A number of worked examples for medical applications are presented in Appendix A, including quadrature mirror filter discrete wavelet transform (QMF DWT) image fusion.",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThis paper describes a framework for applying high level mathematical operations to medical image processing problems. The paper addresses the need of the commuinty for having tools suitable for performing high level operations when analyzing images. The authors develop a toolkit based on \\\\\\\"Mathematica\\\\\\\". The toolkit is available to everybody but the download process requires to get a username/password, the request is always granted.\r\n \r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nThe paper advances the hypothesis that high level mathematical operations are needed in order to solve complex problems in medical image analysis.\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nThe paper in itself does not provide any evicence supporting the claims of the hypothesis, other than citations to previous publications.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nThe paper does not satisfy the basic criteria of Open Science. The source code of the tools is only available upon request. The toolkit itself requires users to have licenses of a commercial product (Mathematica). The autors do not provide input images, nor output images, nor parameters that may make possible for a reader to repeat any of the examples presented in the paper. There is no easy way of verifying what the authors did. The paper is mostly focused on providing verbal support for the notion that they toolkit is extremely powerful and that it provides a cost-effective solution to medical imaging problems.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nAfter contacting the authors, and receiving guidance from them, the reviewer was able to download the toolkit. However this reviewer was not able to reproduce the work reported by the authors due to the lack of an available license of Mathematica. The paper does not provide facilitate the process of replicating the work. In this regards it fails to satisfy the basic criteria of a scientific paper: \\\\\\\"Reproducibility\\\\\\\".\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nThe authors distribute their work as Open Source software, the download process requires to apply for a username/password with the authors, at www.mathvisiontools.net. In order to use the toolkit, the users must have a license of Mathematica.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nThe authors provide the source code upon request. The final paragraph of the paper states that the authors are interested on establishing collaborations with academic and industrial institutions on \\\\\\\"exchange basis\\\\\\\". \r\nIt is not clear what this means in practice. This reviewer suggest that the authors should clarify their position on Open Source, in particular, they should specify the terms under which they are willing to share the source code of the toolkit described in the paper.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nIt was not possible for this reviewer to evaluate the quality of the source code, given that a license of Mathematica was required.\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nThe work of the authors seems to be applicable to a wide range of problems, but this can only be judge so far from the verbal description presented in their paper. At this point there is no way for readers or reviewers to verify the suitability of the MathVisionTools for such potential uses.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nThe authors should clarify their position in Open Source. \r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\nIt seems that they are suggesting a novel licensing agreement for sharing source code. This is worth discussing in detail, since it may be a license that other institutions may want to use too. Currently, there are many different licenses for open source software, and it is always good to have additional alternatives. I would seem that the authors suggest to provide a license based on reciprocity. That is, they may be willing to share their private source with other institutions on the basis that those institutions will also share their private source code with them. This may be too burdersome for the general public to pursue, but still worth considering for specific inter-institutional collaborations.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\nThis reviewer wished the authors could have valued better the opportunity to participate in an Open Science event based on the concepts of enforcing the reproducibility of technical reports. Their paper however is based on the traditional and now outdated approach of providing verbal support for the advantages of their methodology, instead of making it possible for the commuity at large to directly verify such claims by their own experimentation.\r\n",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\n[Short description of the paper. In two or three phrases describe the problem that was addressed by the authors and the approach they took to solve it.]\r\nThis paper describes a software package to be used in conjunction with the Mathematica software for the mathematical prototyping in medical image analysis. The authors make particular mention of the applicability of this tool to the design or rapid prototyping stage of medical image analysis. Their MathVisionTools, as used via Mathematica, provide an interesting resource for algorithm engineers.\r\n \r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\n[If Applicable: Describe the assumptions that the authors have made and they hypothesis of their work, note that not all papers will fit the model of hypothesis driven work, for example, the description of an image database, or the description of a toolkit will not be driven by an hypothesis, in which case, please simply write : \u00e2\u0080\u009cNon Applicable\u00e2\u0080\u009d in this field or delete the subtitle.]\r\nNot Applicable\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\n[Describe the evidence that the authors provide in order to support their claims in the paper. This is a key component on Open Science, opinions that are not supported by evidence should be labeled as \u00e2\u0080\u009cspeculations\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cauthor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinion\u00e2\u0080\u009d while. The same rule applies to the text of the reviews: claims should be supported by evidence]\r\nThis paper provides examples on the following applications:\r\n\r\n1) Differential Calculus on Images\r\n2) Geometry-driven diffusion\r\n\r\nThey show results on hand and brain images.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\n[Describe how much the paper and its addendums adhere to the concept of Open Science. Do the authors provide the source code of the programs used in their experiments? Do the authors provide the input images that they used? Or are those images publicly available? Do the authors provide the output images that they show in the paper? Do the authors provide enough details for you to be able to replicate their work?]\r\nSource Code - The paper states that source code is available on an exchange basis for partners that contribute code to the project.\r\nData - No data is provided. The paper uses two files: \\\\\\'hands.gif\\\\\\' and \\\\\\'mr128.gif\\\\\\' which have not been included with the submission. Likewise the output images have not been submitted.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\n[Did you reproduce the authors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 work?\r\nDid you download their code? Did you compile it? Did you run it?\r\nDid you managed to get the same results that they reported?\r\nWere there information missing from the paper, that was necessary for you to reproduce the work? Suggest improvements that will make easier for future readers to reproduce this work.]\r\nDue to the lack of data, I was unable to reproduce the work.\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\n[Did the authors use Open Source software in their work? Do they describe their experience with it, advantages and disadvantages? Do they provide advice for future users of those Open Source packages?]\r\nThe authors use a pseudo-open source strategy by offering code to \\\\\\\"partners who contribute back to the project\\\\\\\". Additionally, this code assumes the use of proprietary Mathematica, which may not be bad considering the unparalled ability of Mathematica to work at a high level of abstraction.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\n[Do the author\u00e2\u0080\u0099s provide their source code? Is it in a form that is usable? Do they describe clearly how to use of the code? How long did it take you to use that code?]\r\nThe author\\\\\\'s do provide various pieces of the MathVisionTools. I loaded the Mathematica notebooks and was unable to run the code using Mathematica 5.0. It should be noted that I am a relatively new user of mathematica and did not know how to debug the errors.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\n[If the authors provided their source code: Was the code easy to read? Did they use a modern coding style? Did they rely on non-portable mechanism? Was it suitable for multiple-platforms?]\r\nSince the code is written in Mathematica, it is as portable as Mathematica.\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\n[Do you find that the authors methods can be applied to other image analysis problems? Suggest other disciplines or even other specific projects that could take advantage of this work]\r\nThere are many disciplines which can benefit from a Mathematica rapid prototyping tool. This is very nice work which may be extended to other applications.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\n[Suggest to authors future directions for improving their methods, or other domains from which they could learn technique that could help them advance in their research.]\r\nPerhaps you could include more instructions to aid Mathematica beginners to use these tools.\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\n[Did you find that information was missing from the paper? Maybe parameters for running the tests? Maybe some images were missing? Would you like to get more details on how the diagrams, or plots were generated?]\r\nThe data would be nice along with a description of how to run the notebook.\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\n[This is a free-form field]\r\nThere are several spots in the paper which include proofreading comments which should be cut out for the final submitted version.\r\n\r\nThis is very nice work that deserves much credit. My review, however, is based on the Insight Journal reviewer guidelines.\r\n",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThis paper describes a graphical interface as well as a command line tool developed using ITK, VTK, and KWWidgets, to visualize 3D meshes together with information of several types: scalar, vectorial, ellipsoidal and curves over the surface. \r\n \r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nThe authors claim that this tool will strongly simplify qualitative evaluation of data for statistical shape analysis.\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nAs the hypothesis made by the authors is qualitative, the evidence will be demonstrated by the practice, (maybe a table with statistics about time spent by experts to analyze a given set of surfaces could be helpful to support this), but I think this is not really necessary after using the software for a while.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nThe authors provide the source code, as well as the data they show in the main text.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nI was able to download, and successfully compile and run the code in a Linux workstation (after switching from VTK 5.0 to the cvs version of VTK). I had also to compile KWWidgets in order to get the code compiled. \r\nI was able to run the graphical interface, and to load the data they provided, reproducing the images they show in the paper. \r\nThe versions of ITK, VTK and Tcl/Tk, required o suggested to compile and run the software is not provided. I managed to compile it with the cvs version of VTK (version 5.0 is not supported), ITK 2.4.1, and Tcl/Tk 8.4.\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nThe authors used open source software (ITK, VTK and KWWidgets and Tcl/Tk), and they comment that the use of KWWidgets simplify the user interface issues, because it has many built-in support for many VTK components. They don\\'t say which version of the software you should use. \r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nThe source code is completely included. The main program is a graphical user interface which is easy to use. \r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nThe code is written clear, in modern style, using some comments, and in a first view it does not seem to be quite complicated to understand and to use. It also seems to have support to be compiled in WIN32 platform. \r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nThis tool can be also applied to see, for instance, thickness maps over 3D structures that could be quite helpful in areas like computer guided medical diagnosis, when the graymatter thickness is measured and visualized. \r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nThe input mesh is in metafile format, and is loaded in ITK. Other formats could also be included. \r\nIt would be also interesting to add processing capabilities to this tool. \r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\nThe application crashes when you try to load an attribute with different number of points that the loaded a mesh. A restriction to avoid that would be necessary. \r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\nThe interactive colormap managing is a good tool, and can have great advantages for visualization of significances in shapes. \r\nMy final comment to the interested reader is that, although this tool is simple, it could be quite helpful for visualization of attributes over 3D meshes.\r\nThe main problem for some people to start using its own data with this tool can be the file format compatibility. \r\n\r\n",

There is a need for an open source, freely available software allowing for visualizing scalar and vector fields, ellipsoids and space curves. The software provided addresses this issue.\r\n \r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\n\r\nI believe this is a valuable contribution to the MIA open science community specific to the area of visualization.

The software appears simple to use to generate results (see below for more comments).\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\n\r\nThe authors provide the source code, the input text files for generating the different visualizations, the output files (BMPs), and the script needed to re-create most of the results.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\n\r\nI did not reproduce the results. However there is a readme.txt file listing what are the commands that must be called to produce (not all) the figures in the paper.\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\n\r\nThe authors use ITK, VTK, CMAKE, KWWIDGETS, TCL/TK. \r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\n\r\nThe authors provide a readme.txt with the commands needed to regenerate the results.\r\n\r\noutput, data, and code files should have a .tar extension and not a tar.gz extension.

Or 11,21,31,\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 If the 3x3 array is symmetric then why not provide only the 6 distinct elements?\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\n\r\nSource code files have variable amount of comments for example itkMeshTovtkPolyData.cxx has no comments at all.

At completion, over 1200 subjects will be enrolled. Each subject will have a minimum of one CT scan; however, many will likely have 3 CT scans. Each scan will have a corresponding radiological report, clinical report, and histological report. The NHLBI requires that the data collected through the LTRC be anonymized and available to independent researchers. The LTRC imaging database will be the most comprehensive database of lung CT data available to date and will serve as the basis for imaging studies of chronic lung disease for years to come.

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThe authors describe an application of the IGSTK software for robot-guided needle placement. While the paper is loosely about the entire robot-guided application, the method focuses on the registration component of the procedure largely because the is the most critical aspect of the software. The background briefly describes both the hardware and the IGSTK software. The method and results are in regards to the fiducial registration method.\r\n \r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nAlthough not a hypothesis, the premise of the paper is that robot-guided needle placement is an important clinical application and requires effective software. Specifically, the software must be effective at registering the tool to the patient. Once achieved, visualization is important.\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nThe evidence is through a small validation study on a phantom. The details of the validation study are lacking a bit, but the results suggest that the fiducial registration method is effective.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nThis work is completely open science and includes source code which can be used in conjunction with the paper to evaluate and test the method.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nThe source code allows for an evaluation of the method and reproducing the study. The authors also include data in their submission which is great. That being said, there is not much information on the validation study (including the type of phantom) and how the ground truth was determined. Nevertheless, the method is reproducible and would allow another investigator to conduct an independent evaluation.\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nEverything is open source\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nCode is available; however, I did not have the opportunity to review it thoroughly or run it. It does seems sparse on documentation in the code.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nSame as above.\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nOne would hope and expect that the application could be applied to other IGS applications. This provides a nice example of how to use IGSTK in a clinical application.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nThe authors appropriately suggest future work for themselves. I look forward to following this project into the future.\r\nGet going on the clinical trials to show the work that open-source can and should be used to treat patients.\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\nThe paper would benefit from including more references appropriate to the registration method. There are several fiducial based registration papers in the literature.\r\n\r\nThe validation study could be more detailed as well.\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\n[This is a free-form field]\r\n\r\n",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThe paper presents a robot assisted needle placement system based on\r\nIGSTK. The platform has been tested and encouraging results are presented.\r\n \r\n<b>Open Science:</b> The authors provided source code and a data set,\r\nunfortunately one also needs a robot and the intra-operative scanner to\r\nreplicate the findings both of which are unfortunately not so easily\r\ndownloadable or available.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nI downloaded and looked at the code which is of good quality and looks very\r\nsimilar to code in ITK. I did not attempt to compile it as it requires VTK\r\n5 and ITK 2.6 which I did not have installed on my system, however the\r\nInsight Journal dashboard suggests that it compiled just fine.\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nThe authors use the usual combination of ITK/VTK and the IGSTK toolkit (as\r\nimplied by the title). The comment about IGSTK being a safe platform for\r\nresearchers and clinicians to use needs to be qualified, especially since\r\nany additional code (extensions, user applications) is perfectly capable of\r\ncrashing even the most stable of systems. \r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nThe source code is made available (together with IGSTK and FLTK), see\r\nreproducibility above.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nSee reproducibility above.\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nThe methodology developed for the application is fairly crude in terms of\r\nwhat constitutes state of the art image analysis. Having said that, the\r\nresults suggest that it is suitable for the application and perhaps use of\r\nmore sophisticated methods might be overkill. \r\n\r\nThe use of a CT scanner for registration is uncommon though, intra-operative\r\nscanners are not as easily available and use of CT scanner in a patient setup is \r\nkept to a minimum for radiation purposes. This makes the method less applicable to\r\nother problems. Point fiducials are time consuming but often easier to implement \r\nin most common situations.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\n\r\n<OL>\r\n<LI> Figure 4: The word ERROR appears in the textbox below the figure. This\r\nis a dangerous think to publish for anything related to\r\nintervention! While in this case, this is not a serious issue, it should be\r\nqualified in the caption. I assume this is the output from the state\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\n<LI> The validation study is not sufficiently well described. What was the\r\nexperimental setup? Did the authors test the amount of time for which\r\ncommunication with the robot remained stable under stress (also leaving the\r\nconnection on for a few hours without actually invoking it). What is the\r\naffect of accidental disconnection of the robot on the software (cables do\r\nget loose in real situations). In general testing of this type needs to\r\nassume that the worst will happen as it often unfortunately does in the\r\ncase of real interventions.\r\n\r\n<LI> I assume that the authors mean \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"more sophisticated\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as opposed to\r\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"more relaxed\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" registration methods. Iterative closest point methods might\r\nbe appropriate, the authors might also consider robust methods which are\r\nable to do outlier rejection and hence handle any overdetection (the Robust\r\nPoint Matching framework was pioneered by Anand Rangarajan and his\r\ncollaborators comes to mind here, this code is available in various forms).\r\n</LI>\r\n</OL>\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\nThe validation study needs to be better described. What CT scanner was\r\nused what was the environment in which the robot was placed\r\netc. Reproducibility is also critical, how do the results vary if the robot\r\nis imaged twice in the same position, or if the robot is moved back to the\r\nsame position and reimaged. This is really the weak point of this paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

   "abstract": "Statistical Shape Models are a popular method for segmenting three-dimensional medical images. To\r\nobtain the required landmark correspondences, various automatic approaches have been proposed. In\r\nthis work, we present an improved version of minimizing the description length (MDL) of the model. To\r\ninitialize the algorithm, we describe a method to distribute landmarks on the training shapes using a conformal\r\nparameterization function. Then, we introduce a novel procedure to modify landmark positions\r\nlocally without disturbing established correspondences. We employ a gradient descent optimization to\r\nminimize the MDL cost function, speeding up automatic model building by several orders of magnitude\r\nwhen compared to the original MDL approach. The necessary gradient information is estimated from\r\na singular value decomposition, a more accurate technique to calculate the PCA than the commonly\r\nused eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix. In this work, we first present a basic version where\r\nspatial locations are used in the MDL cost function; next, we introduce an extended version where any\r\ncombination of features can be used as a metric. As an example application, we present results based on\r\nlocal curvature measurements. Finally, we present results for synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrating\r\nthe efficiency of our procedures and give details about the implementation using the Insight\r\nToolkit (ITK).",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\n\r\nThe authors present a pipeline for establishing 3D shape correspondence. The implementation is based on concepts from earlier work [2-7], including MDL, shape index and curvedness local features, and establishing correspondence on the unit sphere.\r\n\r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\n\r\n<li> The importance of statistical shape analysis in clinical applications. \r\n<li> The need for open source code and software for establishing 3D shape correspondence statistical model building.\r\n<li> The author\u00e2\u0080\u0099s submission provides a means to perform 3D statistical shape analysis.\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\n\r\nThe authors describe and provide code and sample data for creating statistical shape models. The authors made particular choices regarding how these models are created (e.g. MDL-based, specific local features, specific shape representation).\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\n\r\nSee next section.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\n\r\nITK classes, code and data are provided. See below.\r\n\r\nI downloaded all the files including the source code, but did not build the code. The authors provide an application (see main.cpp), a single data set of cuboids, and an example of command line argument.\r\n\r\nThe authors write: \u00e2\u0080\u009cA detailed overview of how the example application works is useful to demonstrate how the various classes work together. Initially, an instance\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.\u00e2\u0080\u009d. This paragraph is useful for understanding the framework. It would have been helpful to refer the reader to specific lines from the main.cpp file.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe authors write that the framework is flexible enough allowing the use of other local shape features. However, details describing which classes, source code, or virtual functions (?) need to be implemented or modified to accomplish this. I was expecting to find something like: \r\n\r\n ssmCalculator->SetLocalFeatures( ShapeIndexAndCurvedness);\r\n\r\nIn this way the framework may be used to compare the correspondence results and statistical model created when different local features are used. \r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\n\r\nThe authors make use of CMAKE and ITK coding style. Experience or advice related to open source are not given.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\n\r\nThe authors provide the source code (and sample data). Users familiar with CMAKE should be able to build the provided application. CMakeLists.txt is provided.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\n\r\nMain.cpp hardly has any comments. Other random files checked do not have any comments at all.\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\n\r\nCode can be applied to general shape correspondence problems in non-medical applications, for example for shape modelling, geometry processing, and computer graphics.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\n\r\nI think that it would be valuable to provide a class\r\nitk::SpatialObjectToSpatialObjectRegistrationMethod\r\nwhere this work would be an instantiation of.\r\n\r\nPerhaps ImageToImage, SpatialObjectToSpatialObject, ImageToSpatialObject, and SpatialObjectToImage should all inherit from a higher level ObjectToObjectRegistrationMethod.\r\n\r\nIt would be valuable to be able to specify the different components of the shape correspondence (or the SpatialObjectToSpatialObject \u00e2\u0080\u00a6) framework in a manner similar to the current image registration framework of ITK. In the image registration framework the user can set the transform, similarity metric, optimization, interpolation etc. It seems to me it is natural to have a similar framework for shape \u00e2\u0080\u0098registration\u00e2\u0080\u0099, where the following can be set: contours vs surfaces, shape representation, correspondence/mapping representation, local features, cost functions, optimization strategy, etc. This will require a substantial investment in designing such a framework, similar to what has been undertaken for the image registration framework (perhaps even learning from that experience to provide improvements). Such a new framework will be more welcoming for other researchers and developers to create other modules (e.g. a new local feature or cost function). The current submission under review could be thought of as a single instantiation of such a general shape correspondence pipeline. The current submission does have some aspects of this general pipeline. \r\nA tutorial similar to the: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHello World\u00e2\u0080\u009d Registration (section 8.2 in the ITK guide, edition 2, ITK2.4) would be beneficial.\r\n\r\nThe MDL approach ties the correspondence problem with building the statistical shape model. It might be beneficial in some cases to examine different statistical analyses or model building approaches assuming an already established correspondence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is hard to read the text in the flowchart of Figure 4 in the PDF submission. A higher resolution figure would be good.\r\n\r\nCan the framework be applied in 2D to match contours (not surfaces) of shapes?\r\n\r\nIt appears that the software or code used to produce the images and coloring in Figure 2 is not provided. How can these figures be generated?\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThe paper describes an implementation of the paper about conformal flattening of triangle surfaces by Angenent et al. 1999.\r\nThe code uses VTK and ITK, and includes a new ITK class, three applications, and two example surfaces.\r\n\r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nThe paper addresses the flattening of *triangle* surfaces, typically obtained with the Marching Cubes algorithm. The implementation applies to surfaces of genus zero with no boundaries, i.e. closed surfaces with no handles.\r\nA triangle surface can be mapped on a 2D parameterization under one of two constraints: to preserve the area of the triangles (authalic flattening), or to preserve the angles of the triangles (conformal flattening).\r\nThe authors take the conformal flattening approach.\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nTwo example applications are included: one with a synthetic surface and one brain surface.\r\nThe quality of the results is only reported for the synthetic surface. Besides it would be interesting to visualize the angle ratios computed in anglePreserveCheck.\r\nFinally a scalar bar with a title and units would make the figures more informative.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nThe authors provide everything to reproduce the results in the paper. However they do not give some information that the user needs to reproduce similar results with her/his own data.\r\nThe way the triangle meshes were created and the quality of the triangles may dramatically impact the results of the flattening. How the example surfaces were created, and what are the equations or input images?\r\nWhich tools were used, in which order? What are the parameters? What are the potential issues and workarounds (e.g. increasing the value of one parameter)?\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nThe code compiles like a charm on VS8 and is straightforward to use (one input and one output). I got exactly the results reported in the paper.\r\nTo take advantage of the IJ testing facility, the authors may want to add a test in the CMakeLists.txt.\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nThe authors mention that they use \\\\\\'open-source tools\\\\\\', but these tools require manual editing. More information about this editing would help potential users.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nThe three applications are easy to compile, to run and to understand.\r\nTheir code only differs in the visualization parameters of their Display method. Would it make more sense to factorize the surface flattening in a single application and the visualization in another?\r\nThis second application could have two sets of parameters: one for nice.vtk and one for brain.vtk.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nI noticed major VTK memory leaks. For instance instances of vtkIdList are created and never deleted.\r\nTo be consistent with the ITK style, the underscore at the begining of variable names could be removed.\r\nFor the same reason, the name of the class methods could start with a capital letter: setPointP, mapToSphere, mapToPlane, setScale.\r\nAs for the documentation of the methods, it is preferred to write the comments before the method signature.\r\nFuture users of this code would aprreciate if all methods were documented.\r\n\r\nAs it is, the code may cause runtime errors. Calls to \\\\\\'return\\\\\\' are missing after every itkExceptionMacro.\r\nIt is recommended to insert filter->Update() in a try/catch block.\r\nWhy setting point P to -100000 in brainTest.cxx and itkConformalFlatteningFilterTest.cxx?\r\nvtkPolyDataNormals may create some problems since it may duplicate points. In any case, it does not seem to improve the rendering.\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nThe numerous problems that require a 2D parameterization could benefit from this implementation.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nThe authors may be interested in using the topology correction code OpenTopology published in the InsightJournal.\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\nThe implementation could be explained further in the paper (matrix construction, solver for the equation system, vnl functions called, etc.).\r\nHow the equations of section 1 (that can be found in Angenent et al. paper) map to the actual code that the authors contributed?\r\nOnly two sentences at the end of section 1 offer some information about the implementation.\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\nThe information that anglePreserveCheck writes to the standard output needs some revisions: the file is named angleRatioDiff.txt and it contains the ratios for the angles around every node.",

What is the magic number \\'10.0\\' for in the following line: \\' double numOfIter = maxRadius * 10.0 ; \\' ? Is it possible to compute this number from the input SO? Will this number be correct for all cases? Perhaps I am misunderstanding what it is used for, some more comments would help...\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\n1. Use vnl_math::pi (see above).\r\n2. Think about the \\'magic number\\' 10.0 (see above).\r\n3. It\\'s probably wise to separate the single test function into multiple tests. If one test fails, it appears that they <i>all</i> fail, even if this is not the case (because they are in the same function).

   "abstract": "This article presents an approach for decreasing the computational time for converting a sparse SpatialObject to an Image. The method is applicable for SpatialObjects which occupy less volume than the total output Image (which occurs often, especially when using TubeSpatialObjects to represent vessels). A new filter MaskedSpatialObjectToImageFilter is introduced which dramatically decreases the execution time by creating a mask of relevant pixels. The mask is computed by calling the conventional SpatialObjectToImageFilter at a lower resolution, which is significantly faster for large images. The mask is then up-sampled to control which areas are further processed.",

   "abstract": "VoxBo (www.voxbo.org) is a distributed processing framework, developed at the Center of Functional Neuroimaging at the University of Penssylvania, with the purpose of processing and analyzing brain functional MRI data. \r\nVoxBo is written in C++, and it is escentially a fair translation of some SPM functionality, originally written in Matlab. Along with the software, VoxBo defines two new image formats:\r\n1) .cub, a 3D image format, used for anatomical data and single EPI frames. It is important to notice that this format defines a proper origin field, lacking, for instance, in Analyze.\r\n2) .tes, a 4D image format, designed to contain the temporal EPI information. It is worth noticing that this format organizes the voxels in such a way to optimize longitudinal (temporal) voxel access.\r\nFurthermore, the tes format is compressed through encoding of the functional voxels alone, i.e., background voxels are not stored for each frame, but only for the first one.\r\n\r\nIn this work we present the necessary IO classes that allow ImageFileReader and ImageFileWriter to properly identify, read and write .cub files only. We will provide .tes support in a subsequent work.\r\nThis effort is carried out with the purpose of letting VoxBo implementors to take advantage of ITK's power and overcome the limitations currently afflicting VoxBo.",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThe paper describes new ITK classes to read and write in CUB format (used by the application VoxBo).\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nI would like to see a 2D slice of the input image and the same slice after conversion.\r\nThe abstract says \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'no extensive testing is presented and no examples are shown.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' But really it should!\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nThe paper fully adheres to the concept of Open Science. Source code for the classes and for an application are included. The CMakeLists.txt is missing. Please upload a CMakeLists.txt similar to this one:\r\n\r\nPROJECT(VoxBo)\r\n\r\nFIND_PACKAGE( ITK REQUIRED )\r\nINCLUDE( ${ITK_USE_FILE} )\r\n\r\nADD_EXECUTABLE(ConvertImage ConvertImage.cxx itkVoxBoCUBImageIO.cxx itkVoxBoCUBImageIOFactory.cxx)\r\nTARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(ConvertImage ITKIO ITKCommon)\r\n\r\nADD_TEST(ConvertImage\r\n ${OUTPUT_EXECUTABLE_PATH}/ConvertImage inputTestImage.cub outputTestImage.cub)\r\n\r\nOne input image is included. However the paper mentions other input images. They should all be included.\r\nThe output images should also be included as a reference. So the reader could check she/he gets the same output.\r\nThe author could mention whether the input and output files are exact copies (in which case typing \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'diff inputFile outputFile\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' would suffice to check the result).\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nI could not compile the code. I tried on Windows and Mac. The compiler complains about missing zlib.h.\r\nI believe you did run your code and got the results you report in the paper.\r\nSo please write a CMakeLists.txt with some tests and upload it to the InsightJournal.\r\nIt will create a Dashboard and, if there is any error when compiling or running your code, you could check the messages and fix the code.\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nThe author mentions an application called VoxBo. However VoxBo is not required to run the code, but just to check the results.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nThe author decided to contribute all his source code for the benefit of the community. Thanks!\r\nHe just misses the CMakeLists.txt which makes this contribution more challenging to test and use.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nI discourage using #define. Image dimension and number of arguments could simply be hardcoded since your file format is for 3D images and your application always takes 2 arguments.\r\nSecond, it is a good idea to insert the Update calls into try/catch blocks particularly for readers/writers:\r\n\r\n try\r\n {\r\n reader->Update();\r\n }\r\n catch ( itk::ExceptionObject &err )\r\n {\r\n std::cerr << \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Exception caught in reader!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" << std::endl;\r\n std::cerr << err << std::endl;\r\n return EXIT_FAILURE;\r\n }\r\n \r\n writer->SetInput( reader->GetOutput() );\r\n writer->SetFileName( argv[2] );\r\n try\r\n {\r\n writer->Write();\r\n }\r\n catch ( itk::ExceptionObject &err )\r\n {\r\n std::cerr << \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Exception caught in writer!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" << std::endl;\r\n std::cerr << err << std::endl;\r\n return EXIT_FAILURE;\r\n }\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nI would like to see testing of the conversion from/to CUB and other formats (e.g. MetaImage, Analyze, DICOM).\r\nI do understand that some fields may not be propagated.\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\nCMakeLists.txt with tests, outputTestImage.cub, and outputTestImage in other formats.\r\nMake sure it runs on your platform and other platforms.\r\n\r\n<b>Other comments:</b>\r\nWriting reader/writer classes is of paramount importance and is often overlooked by the community.\r\nIt can be very involved to make it successful on all the variants of the file format (consider DICOM!).\r\nA big piece of work has been achieved in this contribution, and I believe only some touch-ups are necessary to have this code used by many.",

An object should touch the border.

I can&#39;t see in your code any efficiency reason to keep that as template parameter. </li><li> There are already some filters in ITK which are manipulating connectivity - the reconstruction filters for example, or the connected component one. The connectivity option is limited to the smallest one (6 in 3D) and the largest on (26 in 3D) without the possibility to use an intermediate value.

The modified code is available at&nbsp;http://voxel.jouy.inra.fr/darcsweb/darcsweb.cgi?r=ITKSkeleton;a=summary <ul><li>ordering input should be managed by the itk pipeline, not as an ivar, so the filter can be fully used in a pipeline </li><li>the filter must require the entire input region to produce correct output.

     "content": "<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br />This paper describes an implementation in ITK of some concepts taken from digital topology. It implements a connectivity framework allowing to calculate the topological numbers of a point in a neighborhood and to discriminate simple points. The authors implement a useful algorithm for skeletonization using binary thinning based on these concepts. In my opinion it is a very useful contribution for the toolkit and one I was particularly interested in.<br /> <br /> <strong>Open Science:</strong><br />Source code as well as an example with data is provided that allows reproducibility.<br /> <br /> <strong>Reproducibility:</strong><br />I was able to compile and reproduce the mentioned results. Latest fixes solve most of the initial compilation problems.<br /> <br /> <strong>Use of Open Source Software:</strong><br />The implementation is based on ITK and is itself an extension of the libraries for some features that are not already implemented.<br /><br /> <strong>Open Source Contributions:</strong><br />The provided source code is readily usable as it is, maybe requiring some minor changes/fixes. Main contributions are a framework for connectivity and an implementation of a skeletonization image filter based on binary thinning. More work could be derived by extending/using these concepts.<br /> <br /> <strong>Code Quality:</strong><br />The implementation is good and well structured, separating the different concepts involved into components. <br />I miss some more documentation/comments in some parts on the code that makes it easier to read.<br />Sometimes it does not follow the ITK coding style.</p><p>Additionally I made some fixes/improvements in the code :<br />- The ordering image type should be a template parameter. I have already been in the need of using an image type different from itk::Image<br />- There where some variables/members/methods that were using char/int where they should use unsigned char/unsigned int, for example the neighborhood image buffer and neighborhood sizes.<br />- I had linking problems with the global method factorial() when integrating it into an application. Changed this to a static method. Also reimplemented Factorial() to avoid recursive function calls.<br /><br />My proposed changes are included as an attachment<br /> <br /> <strong>Applicability to other problems:</strong><br />More imaging algorithms based on concepts of digital topology could be implemented using this work. The skeletonization algorithm is very useful for vessel centerline extraction.<br /> <br /> <strong>Suggestions for future work:</strong><br />I miss some more introductory information in the paper. For example, the definition of simple points which is not obvious for non-experts.<br /> <br /> </p>",

Well-composed images exhibit important topological and geometrical properties not shared by their ill-composed counterparts. \r\nThese properties have important implications for various algorithms used by the ITK community such as thinning algorithms and Marching Cubes. We introduce two image filters which repair images that are ill-composed such that the output images are well-composed.",

Two test images (one 2d, one 3d) are also included.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nCode compiles and runs, but the name of one example file (brain3d.mha) does not match the name coded into the test program (brain3D.mha with capital \\\\\\\"D\\\\\\\").\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nThe algorithm is implemented using ITK and fits within the ITK design.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nSource code is provided. The paper does an excellent job of explaining how to use the implemented filter. \r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nThe code seems quite well written and the style conforms with ITKs coding style. Documentation is lacking (this is why I am rating 4 out of 5) - many fields in the filter class are undocumented. Critical sections of the actual implementation should also be documented in the txx file.\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nSee Suggestions for future work\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nI am wondering - can these algorithms be extended to accomodate multi-label images? One could of course treat each label separately and then merge the resulting corrected binary images back into a corrected multi-label image. Is there anything in the algorithm that prevents ambiguities in such a merging step (it is not a shortcoming of the algorithm if there isn\\\\\\'t such a property, but it would be immensely useful if it did).\r\n\r\nAlternatively - is it conceivable to truly extend the method to multi-label situations and fixing all labels simultaneously?\r\n\r\nI am asking because bad configurations like the ones described here often result when I combine multiple segmentations of a single image using label voting. We have recently proposed \\\\\\\"shape-based averaging\\\\\\\" based on the Euclidean distance transform (Rohlfing & Maurer, MICCAI 2005; IEEE-TIP paper in press December 2006). But that algorithm is extremely computationally expensive (one signed EDT per label and input image), so a morphological algorithm like the one proposed here might be a good alternative.\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\nOne of the beautiful aspects of the proposed algorithms is that it seems to be completely parameter-free. So the description is naturally quite complete.\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\nThis is an extremely well-written paper. Complete yet compact, to the point, and very carefully illustrated. Excellent work, and a pleasure to read!\r\n\r\n",

   "abstract": "There is nowadays an increasing need in interaction between discrete surfaces (2-manifolds) and images. More specifically, segmentation and registration of n-dimensional images are taking advantage of a priori geometrical information, most often provided as discrete 2-manifolds.\r\nMost of the publicly available libraries are oriented either toward mesh processing or image processing.\r\nThrough a careful study we will show that none of those libraries are complete enough to fullfill image, surface and joint image-surface interaction.\r\nWe propose to implement in ITK library a powerful 2-manifold data structure. The choice of ITK was driven by the fact that it provides the best base framework along with a strong n-dimensional image kernel. Based on a Quad-Edge data structure, it has been specifically tailored not only to represent\r\norientable 2-manifolds (surfaces of real objects) but also ease further processing.\r\nWe illustrate the integration of the design into ITK as a native object, enhancing existing algorithms.\r\nWe also illustrate the power of the new design for further surface processing.",

     "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThis paper presents a reworking of ITK\\'s mathematical morphology filters. The work is motivated by a number of factors including convenience, completeness, and performance. As of revision 1, this is a stub article only - the source code contains the developmental versions of all the additional filters, however only the FlatStructuringElement is addressed in the paper. As such, this review focusses on the FlatStructuringElement issues only.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nThis contribution conforms to Open Science by providing all source code, tests, and images.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nI compiled the entire project on WinXP SP2, using MSVC8.0, CMake 2.4.2. I encountered a number of compilation issues:\r\n\r\n1. Project testSE: itkFlatStructuringElement.txx: line 512: <b>ambiguous call to pow()</b>. Microsoft Visual Studio 8.0 on WinXP can not resolve the first argument if it is an int - it must be explicitly cast to a double. eg. \\'unsigned int facets = 8 * (int)pow(4, iterations);\\' becomes \\'unsigned int facets = 8 * (int)pow(4.0, iterations);\\'\r\n\r\n2. Project kernelShape: itkFlatStructuringELement.h: line 67: <b>error C2064: term does not evaluate to a function taking 0 arguments</b>. This one is a little beyond my experience: I looked <a href=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/z72c1dfd.aspx>here</a> for some more info, but it didn\\'t really help. To temporarily resolve this issue in order to continue reviewing, I removed the default argument values and changed all the references to FromImage and GetImage to specifically provide the values (not a very good long term solution - the default parameters are nice! If anyone has any suggestions for getting this to work with MSVS8.0 on WinXP I am willing to test it out).\r\n\r\n3. There are <b>lots</b> of warnings: <b>warning C4804 : unsafe use of type bool in operation</b>. (BTW Gaetan, I have also noticed these warnings when compiling WrapITK). This results from using comparison operations on bools (seeing that the itk::Neighborhood has TPixel=bool). These warnings may scare/confuse some users, so it might be wise to add the following pragma statement somewhere: \\' #pragma warning( disable : 4804) \\'. For sake of ease I have added it to ImageToImageFilter.h in my working copy, but this is probably not the best place for it... Probably better is the header file of each morphological filter .. ?\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nUses ITK.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nExcellent code quality. I like lots of comments, and itkFlatStructuringElement.txx has plenty! \r\n\r\nJust a few minor issues:\r\n1. While the guts of the code is very well commented, the actual header (which users will look to for useage instructions/documentation) is lacking. I feel you should add/enhance the comments for:\r\nBox: eg. \\\" An easy access method for creating a box (2D) or cube (3D) structuring element. This method supports n-D dimensions. \\\"\r\nBall: eg. \\\" An easy access method for creating a circle (2D) or spherical (3D) structuring element. \\\"\r\nPoly: eg. \\\" An easy access method for creating a polygon structuring element. Note that for 3D structuring elements, only the following number of edges are supported: 12, 14, 20, 32. \\\"\r\nFromImage: eg. \\\" Creates an arbitrary structuring element from the given image. \\\"\r\n\r\n2. It is probably worthwhile to comment the Decomposable property in itkFlatStructuringElement.h (just to let users know they don\\'t need to worry too much about it - eg. \\\" This is an internal property to specify if the current structuring element is decomposable. Decomposable structuring elements can be implemented using more efficient/faster algorithms. \\\"). Also to conform to ITK standards maybe use itkGetConstMacro(Decomposable, bool);\r\n\r\n3. (This is a bit of a personal preference but) I like to see any papers which the class implements or was influenced by in the class documentation in the header (ie. include the reference to \\\"Radial Decomposition of Discs and Spheres\\\" - CVGIP: Graphical Models and Image Processing in the header).\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nMathematical morphology has wide application and the enhancements proposed in this article make using morphological filters in ITK more convenient and computationally more efficient.\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\nIs there a reason that you defined M_PI in itkFlatStructuringElement.txx and didn\\'t use the Utilities/vxl/core/vnl/vnl_math.h version (vnl_math::pi) ? \r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\nBTW: I like the images/StrelFromImage.png picture!\r\n\r\n",

This contribution brings such class along with two classes to compose a complex image from real and imaginary or modulus and phase components.<br /> <br /><strong>Evidence:</strong><br />Complex-Complex FFT is useful transform and corresponding filters are missing in ITK<br /> <br /> <strong>Open Science:</strong><br />This submission includes source codes and very simple example code, but with no testing data. I did not compile or execute the example as it does not comply with IJ submission style and requires overwriting parts of my local ITK installation.</p><p><strong>Reproducibility:</strong><br />I suggest adjusting the submission configuration to the IJ Testing Environment and add some tests and test images.</p><p><strong>Use of Open Source Software:</strong><br />These filters should be an extension of ITK.<br /> <br /> <strong>Open Source Contributions:</strong><br />The source code is provided but i found some problems that has to be fixed before the code will be widely usable.<br /> <br /> <strong>Code Quality:</strong><br />Code looks good.</p><p><strong>Applicability to other problems:</strong><br />N/A</p><p><strong>Suggestions for future work and comments:</strong></p><p>FFTComplexToComplexImageFilter</p><ul><li>FFT Direction should be rather a class &quot;property&quot; than a template parameter</li><li>complex to complex FFT is ALWAYS &quot;FullMatrix&quot; - halving of size in first dimension is a property of real to complex (and inverse) FFTs (due to so called Hermitian Redundancy) - see for example FFTW documentation for more details.</li><li>I recommend implementing customized New() method to this base class to enable configuration-based instantiation (see &quot;factories for FFTW filters - update&quot; discussion in Insight-users mailing list)</li></ul><p>FFTWComplexToComplexImageFilter</p><ul><li>I believe, that the current implementation - the way it is handling USE_FFTWD and USE_FFTWF constants and input pixel types - is not very functionable. I think it will work if only one of these constants is defined - if both are (which is not a very rare case), it may fail during compilation. But may be i am wrong in this, as i did not compile the code and i still have some gaps in generic programming:). BUT i highly recommend completely refactoring this class to use (possibly extended) FFTWProxy class as e.g. FFTWRealToComplexConjugateClass does. </li></ul><p><br /><strong>Final sigh</strong>: the optimal way would be to have one FFT filter that will be able to perform all types of FFT transforms (real-complex, complex-real, complex-complex) depending on the input and output image types and Direction property (only in case of complex-complex, as the direction is fully determined by the input and output types in case of &quot;real&quot; FFTs) - so you can focus in this way when refactoring the classes :-) (but of course - having simple complex-complex filter as you are proposing is OK too!) </p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

It&#39;s more like an abstract for a paper than an actual paper. The code being proposed for inclusion in ITK is very specific and concise, but a brief description of the new classes introduced, and why they have the class signature they do would be useful. </p><p><strong>Use of Open Source Software:</strong></p><p>As far as I can tell, completely open. </p><p> <strong>Open Source Contributions:</strong><br />Source Code is included and is nominally useful and mostly correct.</p><p><strong>Code Quality:</strong><br />Suggestions: This code was derived by editing the existing FFT/FFTW real-to-complex and complex-to-real source code. That origional code has changed slightly since the author appropriated it to produce this new set of classes. In order to be compatible with the current FFTW it&#39;s necessary to make copies of the input data, since it gets scribbled on by the fftwX_plan function. Also, the current FFTW/FFT code in Code/Algorithms allocates buffers and preserves the plan memory, so you can instantiate a filter, and re-use it without re-generating the plan. This is a big performance win. </p><p><strong>Applicability to other problems:</strong><br />Generally applicable to FFT based image processing, in cases where Complex image data is the input. This includes use in a pipeline that requires more than one FFT/IFFT operation in an ITK Pipeline, as the intermediate image results can remain in complex numbers. </p><p> <strong>Suggestions for future work:</strong><br /> Revisit the real-to-complex and complex-to-real FFTW filters and incorporate the changes detailed above. Provide some &#39;real world&#39; examples, implementing at least one common use case for FFT in Image processing. </p><p> <strong>Requests for additional information from authors:</strong><br /></p><p><strong>Additional Comments:</strong><br />It&#39;s suggested that the source code provided be copied into the Insight source tree for building and testing. For the purposes of a journal submission, a standalone project that can be built using an already-installed ITK would be a better choice. If the code passes review it can be copied into the Insight source tree one time. </p>",

Since this technique falls into the automatic family, the only time the reviewer spent is for downloading and compiling. Afterwards it just worked.</p><p> <br /> <strong>Code Quality:</strong><br /> The author provides the source code which easy to read. The reviewer used this code on Linux (Debian, Etch and Lenny) and UNIX(FreeBSD 6.3) platforms with gcc 3.4.6, gcc 4.1.2, and gcc 4.2.3 and did not experience any problems. The code runs very fast. On a laptop with Debian-Etch, P4 1.7GHz CPU, and 2GB, using as much as 20 iterations, it takes about one minute to process the 565x440x100 Int16 image. The code follows a modern coding style and the ITK rules so the reviewer would recommend this submission to be included to the ITK lib. </p><p> <br /> <strong>Applicability to other problems:</strong><br />Since the filter is automatic, very fast, and does not require too much hardware resources, it can be used to routinely process sets of large similar images in the environment with dominant background pixels. Examples could be porous material or tubular (scanned alone) studies.<br /><br /> <br /> <strong>Additional Comments:</strong><br /> The author provides a utility which could be used for the initial input parameter evaluation that is very handy. After the input parameters for a particular image set is found, it could be hard coded into a program which afterwards makes the code running fully automated over this set of images.</p>",

   "abstract": "In an earlier submission, we considered 2-D and 3-D digital binary images topologically characterized by their well-composedness. Well-composed images exhibit important topological and geometrical properties not shared by their ill-composed counterparts. These properties have important implications for various algorithms used by the ITK community such as thinning algorithms and Marching Cubes. \r\n\r\nA natural follow-up inquiry to our original submission concerns the possible extension of the binary algorithm to accommodate images with multiple labels. In this paper, we describe such a generalization of our previous submission which also subsumes the binary approach. For completeness and clarity of exposition, we develop the idea of well-composedness within the binary image context and later generalize the discussion to include those images with multiple labels.",

The transform is not meant&nbsp;to&nbsp;be used in the registration framework, as a transform that is optimised.&nbsp;It&nbsp;can be used&nbsp;to resample&nbsp;an image for example. </p><p>This is my first review for the Insight Journal. I apologise if it doesn&#39;t conform to the standards/rules of reviews.</p><p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong><br />Non Applicable</p><p><strong>Evidence:</strong><br />Non Applicable<br /><br /><strong>Open Science:</strong><br />Non Applicable</p><p><strong>Reproducibility:</strong><br />I did not try to compile or run the code</p><p><strong>Use of Open Source Software:</strong><br />ITK</p><p><strong>Open Source Contributions:</strong><br />All necessary code is provided, along with a clear example of usage.</p><p>The paper has quite some overlap with another paper (coauthored by me), 2006-January-June, Combining Transforms in ITK, which&nbsp;describes the CombinationTransform. The advantage of the&nbsp;CombinationTransform is that it supports the registration framework (it implements the Get/SetParameters method) and that it also supports Addition of transforms, instead of Composition. The SerialTransform is however more easy in use, since it accepts more than two&nbsp;transforms. With the CombinationTransform you can set one InitialTransform, which could be again a CombinationTransform; so you need to set the transforms recursively. In the SerialTransform there is simply a list of transforms.</p><p><strong>Code Quality:</strong><br />The code is easy to read. I personally do not like that all function implementations are included the header. I have a few comments:</p><p>- The class provides a method to add transforms to the transform list, but not to clean the transform list. A kind of Initialize() method would be useful.</p><p>- GetInverse could be implemented.</p><p>- The m_TransformList is declared as&nbsp;&quot;private&quot;. I would suggest making it protected, which would allow inheriting classes to provide additional methods to set/get the transforms, or implement&nbsp;the Set/GetParameters,&nbsp;or GetInverse() methods.</p><p>- The implementation of GetJacobian is incorrect. It seems that the author had the &quot;spatial jacobian&quot; in mind. dT/dx, instead of the derivative with respect to the transform parameters, which it should be. Like this it would probably even result in errors, since at line 137-140 the m_Jacobian element (dim,dim) is accessed, while the size of the m_Jacobian is initialised as (dim,0) in the itk::Transform::constructor. Since the Set/GetParameters are not supported by this class, the GetJacobian is useless, I think.</p><p><br /><strong>Applicability to other problems:</strong><br />Non Applicable</p><p><strong>Suggestions for future work:</strong><br />Combining the CombinationTransform and the SerialTransform in one class that has the advantages of both.</p><p><strong>Requests for additional information from authors:</strong><br />none</p><p><strong>Additional Comments:</strong><br />none</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

   "abstract": "The subject of the paper is to introduce a new class of 4D filters to itk.While it is very easy to load a 3D volume stored as a series of DICOM images with ITK, some convenience functions that are already available for 3D volumes are not yet available for the 4D case. Especially for MR data (and to a certain limit also for CT data) it is very important to look at the full 4D series, since the radiologist usually does not make a diagnosis based on a single volume but on the full time series of volumes which shows the temporal flow of the contrast agent. As an example, for breast imaging the radiologist typically examines parameter maps like MIPt (maximum intensity over time), TTP (time to peak) or WI (Wash-In). These parameter maps are the 3D result of post-processing the entire 4D time series. The goal of proposing the denoted 4D filters is to provide ITK with functionality that enables a postprocessing job to handle the entire 4D series as one entity and not as a loose collection of 3D volumes.",

I managed to build the managed libraries but in my case I needed to include two extra (small) steps in the process before successful compilation. Following step 7 (opening the ManagedITK.sln solution) and before step 8 (building) I also needed to:</p> <p><em>7a. Resolve #using Dependencies:</em> The #using compiler directive needs to be told where the ManagedITK.Common.dll is. Point this to the correct directory by way of the property pages Project-&gt;Properties then Configuration Properties-&gt;C/C++-&gt;General and fill in the Resolve #using References field.</p> <p><em>7b. Set the include directory:</em> The location of the include directories are set relatively. These need to be set explicitly (e.g. C:\\\\\\\\ITK\\\\\\\\Utilities\\\\\\\\vxl\\\\\\\\core\\\\\\\\vnl instead of \\\\\\\\Utilities..). This can be set in the property pages (see 7a above) Configuration Properties-&gt;C/C++-&gt;General-&gt;Additional Include Directories.</p> <p>With regard to the examples, without any alteration they all built OK, however, when run they failed to load the ManagedITK libraries and failed. I do not write in C# and I think that this is a problem that could be easily solved given a little more experience of the language. Writing in C++/CLI, the examples, which are clearly explained in the paper, are easily converted and I have had no problems in using ManagedITK from this environment.<br /><br /> <strong>Use of Open Source Software:</strong></p><p>The author produces .NET wrappers for ITK using CMake.<br /> <br /> <strong>Open Source Contributions:</strong><br /> </p><p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">All source code is provided, as are binaries. The build process is well documented in the paper and required only minor modifications in my case (see Reproducibility section above).</p><strong>Code Quality:</strong><br /><p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">The examples provided are well documented both in the paper and throughout the source and concisely summarize the use of the wrapped classes.</p> <p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">I am not experienced in the use of WrapITK, or particularly so with CMake, and so don&rsquo;t feel qualified to comment on the coding relating to these aspects of the project. However, it is important to note that as a non-expert, I was able to create the wrappers from the instructions provided with little hassle (see Reproducibility above).</p> <p><strong>Applicability to other problems:</strong><br /> </p><p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">I feel that a well developed and validated .NET version of ITK would be very welcome. Although there will inevitably be, as acknowledged by the author in the paper, performance loss when developing applications that require managed to native transitions, the ability to rapidly develop GUI applications is very appealing. The author also includes, in Section 2, a list of the pros and cons of using managed over native code in order to enable informed choice of programming language.</p><strong>Suggestions for future work:</strong><br /><p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">In order to get the most from managed ITK, I feel that it is important to be able to interface smoothly and efficiently to managed VTK. Indeed the author points out that this may be used in Section 5 - FAQ. To this end it would be useful for the interface classes ImageToVTKImageFilter and vtkImageToImageFilter to be included in the wrapping.</p> <p>It would be nice if all of the ITK functionality were to be available in the managed environment (in Section 2 under the list of disadvantages the author lists those object not supported). Other issues are also highlighted in the paper by the author for future attention (e.g. location of the managed/native interface to allow for optimised iterative performance).<br /><br /> <strong>Requests for additional information from authors:</strong><br /> </p><p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">I think that a very useful addition to the project would be an expanded explanation of the wrapping procedure (at the moment in the FAQs under &ldquo;How do I wrap an external project&rdquo;). It would be nice if the structure of the CMake files and the effect of the various parameters therein were explicitly stated. </p> <p>Obviously the greater the knowledge of WrapITK and CMake the reader posses, the more sense this section will make. However, a detailed walk through of the wrapping of a class would, I feel, make the process much more accessible to the non-expert reader.<br /><br /> <strong>Additional Comments:<br /></strong><br />N/A<br /> <br /> </p>",

A specific implementation using a Kulback-Liebler type divergence function is provided to illustrate a possible extension of the base class along with test images to illustrate usage.

I have, however, run extensive tests on my own data in a longitudinal deformation-based morphometry study. I find the core algorithm to be very efficient and about as accurate as the original demons algorithm. I was also able to confirm that the produced transformations are essentially diffeomorphic.

The nonrigid registrations in the toolkit are a little outdated right now and could really use some newer algorithms.

I would also advocate including the command line tool that comes with the software in the ITK source tree. </p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

     "content": "<strong>Summary:</strong><br /><p>This paper is an implementation of the original spherical wavelet paper by Swelden. The main goal is to be able to do analysis of (genus 0 = parameterizable on the sphere) shapes. It is becoming a standard approach when coupled with the spherical parameterization for brain surface analysis for example.<br /> <br /> <strong>Hypothesis:<br /></strong><br /><br /><br /> <strong>Evidence:</strong><br /><br /> <strong>Open Science:</strong><br />The paper is clear and explain with sufficient detail the implementation. The implementation seems to be as close as possible to the paper.</p><p><strong>Reproducibility:</strong><br />I downloaded the code, and comfigure it with for the following configuration:<br />cmake 2.4.6, Win32 on top of win64 (XP) MSVC++ 2005 (32bits).</p><p>I needed to apply the following minor changes for the code to compile:<br />itkSWaveletSource.txx:308,309<br />&lt; unsigned long nOfVerts = 10*pow(4,i) + 2; // for icosahedron.<br />&lt; unsigned long nOfNewVerts = 10*pow(4,i+1) + 2; // for icosahedron.<br />---<br />&gt; unsigned long nOfVerts = 10*pow(4.0,(int)i) + 2; // for icosahedron.<br />&gt; unsigned long nOfNewVerts = 10*pow(4.0,(int)i+1) + 2; // for icosahedron.<br />itkSWaveletSource.txx:841<br />&lt; int resolution = 1 + floor(log((nOriVerts-2)/10)/log(4));<br />---<br />&gt; int resolution = 1 + floor(log((nOriVerts-2.0)/10.0)/log(4.0));</p><p>Thedefault example did not work. It seems to exhaust the memory trying to read a file:<br />itkSWaveletTest5.cxx:60 getScalarFn(&quot;x10.txt&quot;, oriF);<br />itkSWaveletTest5.cxx:99 scalarFn.push_back(a);<br />[...]<br />Unhandled exception at 0x7d4e2366 in itkSWaveletTest5.exe: Microsoft C++ exception: std::bad_alloc at memory location 0x0139fb6c..</p><p>It came from my building in a separate tree. The example assumes that you are running it at the sme level as the files. Moreover, the getScalarFn that reads from disk does not check if the file was found and is open before it tries to read from it.<br />Here are the corresponding fixes:<br /> :60,61:<br />getScalarFn(&quot;../x10.txt&quot;, oriF);<br />mySphereMeshSource-&gt;SetScalarFunctionWithSphere( &quot;../para10.meta&quot;, oriF);</p><p>:92,105:<br />void getScalarFn(char* scalarFileName, std::vector&lt; double &gt;&amp; scalarFn)<br />{<br />&nbsp; std::ifstream f(scalarFileName);<br />&nbsp; if( f.fail( ) )<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // print an error here<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exit( EXIT_FAILURE );<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />&nbsp; double a;<br />&nbsp; while(!f.eof())<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f&gt;&gt;a;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scalarFn.push_back(a);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</p><p><strong>Use of Open Source Software:</strong><br />The filter is written on top of ITK.</p><p> <strong>Open Source Contributions:</strong><br />The paper is clear and explain with sufficient detail the implementation.</p><p><strong>Code Quality:</strong><br />As for the design, I love the work on the wavelet coefficients. Being able to access both the mesh and the corresponding wavelet at any level of decomposition is a great idea. It open the way to a lot of applications (compression, watermarking, any filtering, ...).</p><p>The code is not yet up to ITK standard: there seems to be a lot of commented out code. the debug and warning macro are not used (cerr is used instead) and it seems to have be written using arrays first. Some parts have been rewritten using stl (vector) but some parts still used arrays. Testing it through the web interface of KWStyle could help the authors enhance the style greatly (http://66.194.253.24/KWStyle/).</p><p>The types are hard coded, and ,as the author themselves admit, templating it depending on the mesh traits or on other arithmetic types would be great.</p><p>The code is written on top of itk::Mesh and thus must deal with a lot of shortcomings. The authors reimplement a pointToCell array and assume orientability, orientation consistency as well as 2-manifoldness. I&#39;m pretty sure the code would break if you use as input a sphere of which one triangle or more would be flipped inside-out. It would also be nice to check if the mesh is triangular first. I would recommand, if the author had the time, to rewrite it on top of an itkQuadEdgeMesh.

     "content": "<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br />In this paper a nonlinear image registration algorithm is described which uses a block matching strategy. The algorithm uses an entropy based similarity measure, i.e. it is suitable for inter-modality registration. The authors claim that the scheme is very fast due to the avoidance of an optimization step. Results are presented for registering a synthetically transformed 2D image of a person. <br /> <br /> <strong>Hypothesis:</strong><br /> </p><p> The authors claim that a nonlinear registration algorithm based on block matching is a very efficient way for registration. In their opinion many standard algorithms which require optimization of a certain kind are prone to difficult choices of parameter settings, lead to large run-times due to the optimization and are hard to parallelize. Further, they claim that methods based on so-called differential similarity measures (the second group of approaches for nonlinear registration) can be fast and accurate but in practice are complex to implement for inter-modality similarity measures, require a large number of iterations, require derivatives whose computation leads to smoothing and have problems with boundaries.</p><p> Starting from these problems and due to the fact that the MPEG standard performs block matching as well the authors propose that block matching is a well-suited nonlinear registration method. They claim that block matching is simple to formulate and implement, is numerically stable, easy to parallelize (i.e. suitable for hardware implementation), is robust against noise and requires only few parameters. </p><p><br /> <strong>Evidence:</strong></p><p>The authors categorization of nonlinear registration into global optimization, differential similarity measures and block matching schemes is in my opinion not very useful. To use the term global optimization in the context of nonlinear registration is dangerous. IMHO there are no reported global optimization techniques, since the parameter space of the nonlinear registration problem is far to large for that. All of the reported algorithms are local optimization based and require good initializations and pyramid schemes to work and to reach a local optimum as registration result. Further, to me it is not quite clear what is meant by methods based on differential similarity measures. If this is the Demons-like approach or the B-spline based approach, then they can also be categorized as optimization-based, since their formulation also seeks for a local optimum over a certain parameterization of the space of unknowns. </p><p> The claim that nonlinear registration algorithms are hard to parallelize is contradicted by the implementations of the algorithms in ITK and by another contribution of this workshop from Aylward et al. The speed differences could not be reproduced by the author of this review. Although the performance of the fast block matching scheme is a lot faster than e.g. B-spline, its run-time is similar to Demons on real-world 3D medical volumes. This fact can be seen from our own evaluation of the method in the evaluation paper we submitted to this workshop (Urschler et al). Last, the authors criticize standard algorithms for requiring derivatives leading to smoothing. Without knowing the exact details of the block matching scheme, I think that there are also some implicit assumptions in each block matching that lead to an implicit smoothing of the data. </p><p>It would be very useful if this paper would explain a little more of the details of the block matching scheme and if there would be a better explanation of the parameters that were used. </p><p><br /> <strong>Open Science:</strong><br /> </p><p>Source Code of their method and the output of their algorithm on the test image are provided for comparison. It would be easily possible to replicate the authors claims if the code would build.</p><p><br /> <strong>Reproducibility:</strong></p><p>I tried to reproduce the authors work directly under Windows using MSVC 8 compiler in the free edition. However, I didn&#39;t manage to compile the code since it has a hard-coded requirement to use ITK 2.8.1. I&#39;m using the current release of ITK (3.2) and didn&#39;t try to fix this problem. I suggest that this flaw to require exactly ITK2.8.1 should be replaced by requiring AT LEAST ITK 2.8 or higher! </p><p>So the direct reproduction of the algorithm&#39;s performance on the example 2d image was not possible. However, I took the code and put it into the evaluation framework which was contributed to this same workshop in Urschler et al. There the results for intra-modality registration using several synthetic data sets and a number of comparison measures on real-world 3D medical volumes are presented. The results are not very promising as can be seen from the numbers and the visual outcome. I understand that this contribution is an early work in progress. Note, that I used the same parameters as in the authors source code. It is also perhaps important to note that I am solely providing intra-modality data while the contribution claims to be an inter-modality algorithm due to the entropy based similarity measure. I do not see why it should not work on intra-modality data, however, this might be a possible problem and might not have been tested yet by the authors. I invite the authors to look at my wrapper class around their source code and check if I made any coding mistake. Further, they can reproduce my evaluation and perhaps fine-tune their algorithm to perform better on the 3D intra-modality data. </p><p><br /> <strong>Use of Open Source Software:</strong><br />Not Applicable<br /> </p><p><strong>Open Source Contributions:</strong><br />The source code is provided and easy to use as it is - if you plug it out of the contributed package (ITK 2.8 restriction). </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Code Quality:</strong></p><p>The coding style of ITK is supported, the code is working under Windows MSVC 8 and Linux gcc 4.1 (64 bit). The authors claim in the paper that some refactoring is necessary to split the main class into modules. </p><p> <br /> <strong>Applicability to other problems:</strong></p><p>A working code could be applied to any nonlinear registration problem. </p><p><br /> <strong>Suggestions for future work:</strong></p><p>For future work a more thorough preparation of the related work might be interesting. Also there was a publication by Bostjan Likar and Franjo Pernus in 2001 in Image and Vision Computing (A hierarchical approach to elastic registration based on mutual information) who have shown a block matching related nonlinear registration scheme which would be interesting to compare to. Some of the claims that lead to the implementation do not sound convincing to me. Further work is necessary in the implementation of the algorithm and in testing it on real-world medical applications. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> <strong>Requests for additional information from authors:</strong><br />As I already mentioned a more detailed explanation of the algorithm and the parameters would be useful. Although one could look it up in the mentioned additional papers, it would be good to be a little more self-contained here. </p><p> <br /> <strong>Additional Comments:</strong></p><p>Fast block matching is an interesting direction however in this contribution its derivation and its advantages are not yet presented very well. Further, some additional evaluation of our own does not yet show the claimed key contributions. This might be an issue due to the work-in-progress state of the paper, however, the authors have yet to prove that. </p>",

Unfortunately the link to download all contributed material does not work at the time of this writing, so this review will solely be based on looking at the paper (which I took from the MIDAS &amp; Kitware collection using the papers DSpace handle) and on the presented material on the accompanying webpage.<br /> <br /> <strong>Reproducibility:</strong><br />I did not reproduce the mentioned experiments or download any code.<br /> <br /> <strong>Use of Open Source Software:</strong><br />NA<br /> <br /> <strong>Open Source Contributions:</strong><br />As already mentioned I was not able to use any provided code.<br /> <br /> <strong>Code Quality:</strong><br />NA<br /> <br /> <strong>Applicability to other problems:</strong><br />The basic idea of providing evaluation databases and criteria along with some results from other methods for comparison is in the review authors opinion (and I dare to say also in the opinion of many more people in the medical imaging community) an extremely important one. Successes from other disciplines like computer vision (stereo reconstruction, multi-view 3D reconstruction -&gt; Middlebury) or pattern recognition (face recognition databases) prove this importance despite the additional legal, ethical and of course commercial problems such an effort has in the medical community. <br /> <br /> <strong>Suggestions for future work:</strong><br /> The only suggestion I currently can think of is to contribute this web-site to the list of open-science databases proposed in the workshop paper of Holms et al (Data, data everywhere). </p><p><br /> <br /> <strong>Additional Comments:</strong></p><p>Overall this paper is an important open-science contribution and IMHO should definitely be accepted for the workshop to further discuss its ideas. It is very well and clearly written, shows a good over-view of the related work, although there are some segmentation evaluation efforts like e.g. the VALMET project (Gerig et al @ MICCAI 2001) or Fenster and Chu (Evaluation of Segmentation Algorithms for Medical Imaging, IEEE-EMBS 2005) which could also be mentioned. One can of course think about the advantages and drawbacks of a watershed type segmentation to get the automatic results, but this is not the main point of this contribution. Overall very promising and I am looking forward to discussions at the workshop. </p>",

   "abstract": "Volumetric layers often encountered in medical image analysis are characterized by double and nested bounding surfaces. The thickness of a volumetric layer at a point on the bounding surface is the distance from that point to the opposite surface. There exist several definitions for the layer thickness. A newly proposed thickness definition is the radial thickness, which is defined as the distance between each pair of corresponding points on the two surfaces with the same polar coordinate. The thickness values calculated by the radial thickness definition are unique and does not depend on the starting surface. In this paper, we describe a class for calculating the radial thickness of one volumetric layer represented as coupled and nested triangle meshes. \r\n\r\nThe class, vtkRadialThicknessCalculate, is implemented using the Visualization Toolkit (VTK). In this document, we describe the radial thickness calculation algorithm and provide the user with the source code and the input data to reproduce the results. The radial thickness calculation described in this paper has a variety of applications including the thickness calculation for the skull vault, which is the original motivation for this work.",

A quick &quot;string text&quot; comparison of the provided output files against the output files that I got when running the provided tests indicate that the numerical values are very close.</p><p>It was very easy to rerun the code. The authors did a great job on facilitating the reproducibility of the code.</p><p>I couldn&#39;t reproduce Figure 2 with KWMeshVisu , where the inner and outer surfaces are shown using transparency. Not a big deal, I guess the figure was generated with a vtk script. </p><p>When attempting to do it using ParaView, it seems that the topology of the mesh is not well constructed.

(or not ?)</p><p>As a compact task for a course project, it will be nice to create an ITK version of this filter. For example based on the recently added QuadEdgeMesh.&nbsp;</p><p><br /> <br /> <strong>Requests for additional information from authors:</strong></p><p>The radial distance is critically dependent of the choice of center of polar coordinates. </p><p>The authors missed to elaborate a bit more on how important that choice is, and how they computed the center. </p><p>The class provide the option of using precomputed directions, but surprisingly it doesn&#39;t allow the user to provide a customized center. </p><p>Such option will be very easy to add. </p><p>This extra option is important because in many anatomical structure, the centroid of the surface, is not necessarily the best center of polar coordinates for describing the surface. For example if I had a section of the femur condyle and I&#39;m interested in measuring cartilage thickness, I should use the center of the (almost spherical) condyle joint, as opposed to the centroid of the points that happen to be in the section of surface that I have.</p><p>Fortunately, the code modifications are minimal. It is probably enough to add an enum mode for selecting between using a user-provided center or computing a center from the master surface.<br /><br /><br /> <br /> <strong>Additional Comments:</strong><br /> </p><p>Great paper !.</p><p>&nbsp;It is refreshing to finally get to perform real &quot;peer-reviews&quot; by actually being able to replicate the work that is described in a paper. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

   "abstract": "At the Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Engineering Research Center for Computer-Integrated Surgical Systems and Technology (ERC-CISST) laboratory, we have designed and developed a platformindependent C++ software package, called the nArray library, that provides a unified framework for efficiently working with multidimensional data sets. In this paper, we present and discuss the core elements of the library, including its intuitive and uniform API, efficient arithmetic engine algorithm, and efficient sub-volume algorithm. We then compare the performance of the nArray library with that of an existing multidimensional array toolkit, ITK. We conclude that the nArray library is more efficient than ITK in many situations, especially in operations on sub-arrays, and that the two packages have comparable performance in many other scenarios. The underlying algorithms, if incorporated in ITK, can help improve its performance.",

The authors provide their source code and detailed instructions (in the form of well configured tests) on how to run the same benchmarks that are presented in the paper.</p><p><br /> <strong>Reproducibility:</strong></p><p>It was straight forward to reproduce the work that the authors describe in their paper.</p><p>The source code of the library was provided with the paper, along with the source code of the benchmarks that compared nArray performance against ITK.</p><p>It was very easy to configure, build and run the code.</p><p>I build it on Debian Linux, in a dual processon Xeon 2.4GHz, 3Gb RAM, build with gcc 4.1, for Release </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Given that the machine I used is different from what the authors used, the actual numerical output of the Benchmarks are different from what appears in the paper. </p><p>&nbsp;However, this simply highlight how important is that benchmark comparisons have to be performed by providing readers the means of repeating the benchmark on their own local environment. </p><p>The authors did a great job of organizing and configuring the benchmark test s in such a way that they are almost trivial to execute. </p><p>The outputs in my system are:</p><ul><li>ImageAdd_ITK_Benchmark Window Extract 21032 Sum 18100 WindowsExtract and sum 39119 <br /></li><li>ImageAdd_nArray_Benchmark SumOf time 7488 operator + time 14076</li><li>Subarray_ITK_Benchmark Fill time 416537 Window time 10926 Slice time 478 Permute time 231274<br /></li><li>Subarray_nArray_Benchmark Fill time&nbsp; 360814&nbsp; Window time 5225&nbsp; Slice time 214&nbsp; Permute time 192745<br /></li></ul><p> It wasn&#39;t obvious how to map these numbers into the corresponding cells of the Table 3, in page 13 of the paper.... </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The benchmark conclusions are a bit misleading in the abstract and the conclusions sections. Specially given that several of the comparison showed that nArray methods are faster in some cases and slower in some other cases.&nbsp; In any case, the advantage of the paper is that the source code for both ITK and nArray is available, and the authors made the benchmarks available for inspections to the readers. This makes possible to verify how the code performs in other platform combinations.&nbsp;</p><p><br /> <strong>Use of Open Source Software:</strong></p><p>The authors used ITK as a reference to compare the performance of nArray.</p><p>nArray was also configured using CMake&nbsp;</p><p> <br /> <strong>Open Source Contributions:</strong></p><p>The authors provide the source code of nArray and distribute it under a thoughtful license. </p><p>The code is very well organized, and it was straight forward to use. <br /><br /> <br /> <strong>Code Quality:</strong></p><p><br />The source code is very well written. It uses a consistent coding style. The coding style is different from ITK&#39;s but that&#39;s not a concern given that nArray is a library and if used from ITK it will probably be included in the Utilities directory and then its functionalities will be invoked from there. </p><p>I build the code only in Linux, so I didn&#39;t verified the portability of the code. However the authors present results for Linux and Windows, and from the structure of the code there are no reasons to believe that it couldn&#39;t be widely portable. </p><p> <br /> <strong>Applicability to other problems:</strong></p><p>Since the nArray library provide such a fundamental functionality of storage, data access and basic data processing there is an endless list of applications for it. </p><p>It is certainly worth to explore mechanisms for integrating this library with ITK, whether by making easy for users to use simultaneously ITK images and nArrays, for example via ImageAdaptors, or via specialized version of the nArray___Ref classes that could actually point to an ITK image allocated buffer.<br /><br /> <br /> <strong>Suggestions for future work:</strong></p><p>Exploring combinations of ITK and nArray are probably the most interesting next step. This will make possible for application developers to take advantage of nArray qualities in certain operations of their applications, while using ITK for other operations, and in this way get the best of each world. This could be implemented as</p><ul><li>An itkImage-like class that reuses the memory allocated by an nArray, maskarading the nArray iterations as an itkPixelContainer</li><li>An nArray___Ref class that connects to an ITK image buffer instead of an actual memory block allocated by an nArray class.</li></ul><p> <br /> <strong>Requests for additional information from authors:</strong></p><p>I missed from the paper some comments regarding the impact of multi-threading. Specially considering the fact that one of the machines used by the authors is a dual processor, and that the AddImageFilter in ITK is multi-threaded. We assume that the nArray algorithms are multi-threaded, but there is no explicit mention of it in the paper. If nArray, is not multi-threader, then the timing reported are even more impressive, since it will mean that (at least in one platform) their speed more that doubled ITK performance.</p><p>A quick grepping on the source code of the authors seem to indicate that no multi-threading is being used in nArray. If that&#39;s the case, the results of the benchmark must be re-analized under this light, and,.... it also becomes interesting to consider multi-threading nArray, in order to get even better performance.</p><p><br /> <strong>Additional Comments:</strong></p><p>It will be very interesting, and very useful to the ITK community to explore mechanisms for bringing the advantages of nArray into ITK. </p><p>Several mechanisms come to mind</p><ul><li>Creating specialized ITK filters whose internal implementation uses nArray</li><li>Studying the internal implementation of nArray and compare it to ITK image iterators, to improve the implementation of the ITK iterators. Such improvements will then automatically improve the performance of ITK filters since almost all of them are based on image iterators.</li><li>Making easy to combine ITK images and nArray via ImageAdaptors (or nArray adaptors), so that an existing nArray could be accessed as an ITK image, or an ITK image be access like an nArray. Both options seem to be perfectly feasible. </li></ul>",

This was done using a templated interface approach and some novel implementation techniques.<br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><strong>Evidence:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\\\\\\\"font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana\\\\\\\">Table 1 provides a sampling of the API, and discussions on nArray engines and iterators, plus the associated code samples, illustrate key aspects of the API usage and support the notion that the interface is generally easy to use.</span></p><p><span style=\\\\\\\"font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana\\\\\\\">I would have liked to see a more complete treatment of the API in the paper, rather than referring to the package itself for more details, and more specific examples of how the API is superior to ITK, given that the ease of use improvement was one of the primary goals.</span></p><p><span style=\\\\\\\"font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana\\\\\\\">Section 4 details the performance benchmarking strategy versus ITK, provides references to the source code used, identifies the two system configurations used, and provides the numerical performance results along with a results analysis.</span></p><p><span style=\\\\\\\"font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana\\\\\\\">The performance results and analysis supported the claim that the package is at least comparable to ITK, but I would have liked to see that done more conclusively, given that this was a primary goal of the work. Although it can be exceptionally difficult or impossible to hunt down the root causes for the wide variability in performance in such packages, a serious effort in this regard, including platform specific optimizations, if necessary, could possibly take this package to the level of a standard.</span></p><p><span style=\\\\\\\"font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana\\\\\\\"><strong>Open Science:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\\\\\\\"font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana\\\\\\\">A link to the CISST Software Package is provided in the references. I assumed it would be straightforward to locate and compile the nArray library from the package, but did not do so myself. References to the source code used for benchmarking are provided in the text. I assumed these are located in the CISST Software Package.</span></p><p><span style=\\\\\\\"font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana\\\\\\\"><strong>Reproducibility:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\\\\\\\"font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana\\\\\\\">I have not attempted to reproduce the author&rsquo;s work.</span></p><p><span style=\\\\\\\"font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana\\\\\\\"><strong>Use of Open Source Software:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\\\\\\\"font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana\\\\\\\">The authors directly compared their work to ITK.</span></p><p><span style=\\\\\\\"font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana\\\\\\\"><strong>Open Source Contributions:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\\\\\\\"font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana\\\\\\\">The authors provide links to their source code. I did not see a reference to the applicable licenses for the code, which would be an improvement if added.</span></p><p><span style=\\\\\\\"font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana\\\\\\\"><strong>Code Quality:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\\\\\\\"font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana\\\\\\\">The code is clearly suitable for multi-platform use. The implementation discussion leads one to assume that the code is of excellent quality, in particular, the appropriate use of templates, and the stated accomplishment of conformance with STL&rsquo;s specification for a random access iterator.</span></p><p><span style=\\\\\\\"font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana\\\\\\\"><strong>Applicability to other problems:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\\\\\\\"font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana\\\\\\\">The authors are attempting to improve on a fundamental aspect of image analysis programming. This work would be applicable to a wide variety of problems, not limited to the image analysis domain.</span></p><p><span style=\\\\\\\"font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana\\\\\\\"><strong>Suggestions for future work:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\\\\\\\"font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana\\\\\\\">See evidence section.</span></p><p><span style=\\\\\\\"font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana\\\\\\\">Also, it was not clear if the recursive function in section 3.3 was actual code from the package or presented to support the explanation only. If it represents the actual code, I would be interested in seeing if any performance difference can be derived by using a much less elegant non-recursive version, since use of recursion in such cases can be inefficient.</span></p><p><span style=\\\\\\\"font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana\\\\\\\"><strong>Additional Comments:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\\\\\\\"font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Verdana\\\\\\\">In general, I felt as though this has the potential to be a valuable contribution to the field, and that the ITK implementation could indeed be improved through the use of the described methods. The paper, however, seemed to lose focus from its objectives somewhat, in that it shifts to detailing the novelties of the implementation, rather than proving out it&rsquo;s goals, which seemed the more appropriate use of the reader&rsquo;s time at this level. The implementation details were, of course, also very interesting.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

     "content": "<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br />This paper presents a set of ITK classes for efficient kernel-based filters. The authors provide source-code and results for various mechanisms including: separable filters, histogram-based kernels, and decomposition of morphological structuring elements. The results indicate the newly-implemented methods are faster than the basic approaches currently implemented in ITK (with some constraints, as discussed in the paper).<br /> <br /> <strong>Hypothesis:</strong><br />The efficient implementations are faster (with some constraints) than the existing ITK implementations.<br /> <br /> <strong>Evidence:</strong><br />Section 7 of the paper displays graphs of different algorithm performance and the Appendix lists the results in tabular format. The code used to generate the graphs and text file output is provided with the article.<br /> <br /> <strong>Open Science:</strong><br />The authors provide the input images, source code, and results used in their experiments.<br /> <br /> <strong>Reproducibility:</strong><br />I have downloaded, compiled, and run parts of the work. I did not run the performance analysis code, but I have used some of the filters in my own application (mostly the morphological filters) and anecdotal evidence suggest the speed-ups are valid.<br /><br />I did have some trouble compiling the code: the compiler I used (Microsoft Visual Studio 8.0.50727.762) complained about an ambiguous call to overloaded function &#39;pow&#39; in itkFlatStructuringElement. This was fixed by casting the base to double, eg.<br /><br /> unsigned int facets = 8 * (int)pow((double)4, iterations);<br /> <br /> <strong>Use of Open Source Software:</strong><br />The work extends ITK.<br /> <br /> <strong>Open Source Contributions:</strong><br />The full source-code is provided.<br /> <br /> <strong>Code Quality:</strong><br />The code quality is good and matches ITK standards. However, some of the documentation needs further work:</p><ul><li>The \\\\\\\\brief for itkSeparableImageFilter could be improved, eg. &quot;A filter for performing kernel operations using decomposition&quot; instead of &quot;A separable filter for filter which are using kernel&quot;, similar for itkSeparableRadiusImageFilter</li><li>itkAnchorCloseImageFilter and itkAnchorOpenImageFilter classes have no documentation</li><li>The documentation for the static constructors in itkFlatStructuringElement need work before integration into the toolkit, these methods are important and should be well documented for users</li><li>The documentation in itkMovingHistogramDilateImageFilter and itkMovingHistogramErodeImageFilter erronously refers to MorphologicalGradient <br /></li></ul><p>On the plus side, the documentation for itkMovingHistogramImageFilter (and others) is excellent!</p><p>I dislike the static const int declarations of the algorithm type, mainly because it is declared 4 separate times: itkGrayscaleMorphologicalOpeningImageFilter, itkGrayscaleMorphologicalClosingImageFilter, itkGrayscaleDilateImageFilter, and itkGrayscaleErodeImageFilter. Can the algorithm type be declared once in a header file? Also, ITK seems to favour enum types (see: itkRegularStepGradientDescentBaseOptimizer), should it be an enum?<br /> </p><p>I also stumbled across a bug / problem with itkSeparableImageFilter.txx: the output is not correctly grafted. The following line needs to be added above the update for the last filter:</p><p>m_Filters[TInputImage::ImageDimension - 1]-&gt;GraftOutput( this-&gt;GetOutput() );&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Applicability to other problems:</strong><br />The work is applicable to a wide of range of image processing problems, not only in the medical domain.<br /> <br /> <strong>Suggestions for future work:</strong></p><ul><li>Addition of the Annulus operator (see attachment) and Cross operator to itkFlatStructuringElement</li><li>The itkSeparableImageFilter and itkMaskedSeparableImageFilter classes were of particular interest to me, but I was disappointed to find no morphological operations utilising these (at least that I could find) and no comparisons of speeds for Box structuring elements of basic, histogram, anchor, and <em>separable </em>approaches. I have implemented separable dilation and erosion using the basic approach (see attachment). A moving histogram approach could also be implemented. Perhaps these classes can be added in the darcs repository / toolkit?</li></ul><p><strong>Overall:</strong><br />A comprehensive article which discusses a number of very useful filters (many of which I have already started using).

SharpImage is a stand-alone Windows application geared towards the pre-processing and creation of volume illustrations, although other generic tasks are inherently supported. The user interacts with the environment using a command console, and can view images as a series of slices or through volume rendering. We describe the design and introduce functionality using a number of examples. We have found the environment useful for prototyping a range of image processing tasks and provide the source-code in the hope others may also find it useful.",

   "abstract": "This paper presents an extension of the Visualization ToolKit dedicated to spatiotemporal data synchronization, visualization and management. It basically consists in a versatile library providing functionalities to help developers setting up sophisticated applications with minimal development effort. In the medical imaging context, various types of data are often encountered, which raises the need for adapted visualization and synchronization techniques. Moreover, the management of these data (organization, creation, deletion, access) can become a burden. We propose in vtkINRIA3D a strategy to synchronize interactions between datasets representations, to manipulate complex objects (e.g., neural fibers as obtained in DT-MRI), as well as a managing framework for organizing data (including temporal sequences). The efficiency of vtkINRIA3D is illustrated with two applications: MedINRIA (general medical image processing software) and CardioViz3D (cardiac image visualization). vtkINRIA3D is open-source, and comes with a set of examples, test data and softwares built upon it: http://www-sop.inria.fr/asclepios/software/vtkINRIA3D.",

   "abstract": "Performance validation of nonlinear registration algorithms is a difficult problem due to the lack of a suitable ground truth in most applications. However, the ill-posed nature of the nonlinear registration problem and the large space of possible solutions makes the quantitative evaluation of algorithms extremely\r\nimportant. We argue that finding a standardized way of performing evaluation and comparing existing and new algorithms currently is more important than inventing novel methods. While there are already existing evaluation frameworks for nonlinear inter-subject brain registration applications, there is still a lack of protocols for intra-subject studies or soft tissue organs. In this work we present\r\nsuch a framework which is designed in an \u201dopen-source\u201d and \u201dopen-data\u201d manner around the Insight Segmentation & Registration Toolkit. The goal of our work is to provide the research community with the basis framework that should be extended by interested people in a community effort to gain importance for evaluation studies. We demonstrate our proposed framework on a sample evaluation and release its implementation and associated tools to the public domain.",

In addition, many researchers are interested in providing their data to the greater research community, but may be unaware of the process to release the data. The purpose of this paper is to describe our efforts in developing an open website which includes information on accessible medical image databases as well as some of the logistics for providing an open image database.

I did this and incorporated some other changes (see attachment). These include:</p><p>- LookAtTransformInitializer changed to LookAtTransform that inherits Rigid3DTransform.</p><p>- m_Image is no longer a member as it is unnecessary just to specify output spacing. This spacing is incorporated as argument to the call SetPlane().</p><p>- The output spacing does not need to be the same as the input image spacing. Changed this (see previous).</p><p>- The template parameter for the transform is the 2D image, not the 3D image. This makes more sense in my opinion.</p><p> With respects to the tests, there is no usage information for command line as in ITK examples.</p><p> <br /> <strong>Applicability to other problems:</strong></p><p>The method can be applied to any problem that requires the extraction of a section given its center and normal. </p><p> <strong>Suggestions for future work:</strong><br /> </p><p>None. </p><p><strong>Requests for additional information from authors:</strong></p><p>None. </p><p> <strong>Additional Comments:</strong></p><p>There is an error in the figure description.

   "abstract": "As part of the Center of Excellence in Genomic Science at Caltech, we have initiated the Digital Fish\r\nProject. Our goal is to use in toto imaging of developing transgenic zebrafish embryos on a genomic scale\r\nto acquire digital, quantitative, cell-based, molecular data suitable for modelling the biological circuits\r\nthat turn an egg into an embryo. In toto imaging uses confocal/2-photon microscopy to capture the\r\nentire volume of organs and eventually whole embryos at cellular resolution every few minutes in living\r\nspecimens thoughout their development. The embryos are labelled such that nuclei are one color and cell\r\nmembranes another color to allow cells to be segmented and tracked as they move and divide. The use\r\nof a transgenic marker in a third color allows a variety of molecular data to be marked. In toto imaging\r\ngenerates 4-d image sets (xyzt) which can contain 100,000 to 1,000,000 images per experiment. We are\r\ndeveloping a software package called GoFigure to visualize, segment, and analyze these very large image\r\nsets. GoFigure uses a MySQL database back end for managing storage of images and segmented objects\r\nand uses VTK and ITK for visualization and segmentation. We plan to use in toto imaging to digitize the\r\ncomplete expression and subcellular localization patterns of thousands of proteins throughout zebrafish\r\nembryogenesis. This genomic data, our zebrafish lines, and GoFigure will be distributed following the\r\nOpen Data/Open Source model.",

     "content": "<p><strong>Summary:<br /></strong>An image-based approach to systems biology allows both cell lineage trees and quantitative molecular data to be gathered over time and at cellular resolution.&nbsp; This paper describes GoFigure, a software package for the image processing of four-dimensional in toto images with the overall goal of extracting these two types of data.&nbsp; In particular, the development of zebrafish embryos will be studied at the cellular level in order to discover more about the genetic circuits underlying embryogenesis.&nbsp; Although still in progess, once completed this project will be an excellent contribution to the open source community in systems biology, as a very large collection of molecular data (the &quot;Digital Fish&quot;) and GoFigure itself will be released in an open source fashion.<br /><br /><strong>Hypothesis:<br /></strong>The overall hypothesis is that an image-based approach to systems biology yields accurate and reliable molecular and cell lineage data.&nbsp; Although no hard&nbsp;evidence to support this is provided per se, the rationale behind their approach is extensively discussed and in my opinion makes a lot of sense.<br /><br /><strong>Evidence:<br /></strong>1)&nbsp; The advantages of an image-based approach to systems biology over more traditional molecular approaches are clear and convincing.&nbsp; 2) The authors claim that &quot;computers have a notoriously difficult time (spotting cells in microscopic images)&quot; but do not reference previous (presumably unsuccessful attempts) by themselves or others to solve this problem. 3) The authors claim that &quot;we cannot predict how when and where a protein will be expressed, we cannot predict how a protein will fold and function once it is translated, and we cannot predict the interaction between expressed proteins that allow them to form functional genetic circuits&quot; without mentioning previous bioinformatics work on subcellular localization, protein folding and reverse engineering of genetic networks.&nbsp; Although a thorough overview of systems biology is obviously not necessary in this paper, the wording of this part of the introduction would likely make the newcomer falsely think that these problems have never been attempted before. <br /><br /><strong>Open Science:<br /></strong>Although the authors&nbsp;mention that the GoFigure software package and their data will be released in an open-source&nbsp;manner, no code, code documentation, images or data&nbsp;are provided with this submission.<br /><br /><strong>Reproducibility:<br /></strong>I could not reproduce the authors&#39; work because no source code was provided.<br /><br /><strong>Use of Open Source Software:<br /></strong>The authors use VTK and ITK for visualization and segmentation, as well as CMake and CPack.&nbsp; The authors also mention their plans to use a KWStyle GUI and perhaps Qt in the future.<br /><br /><strong>Open Source Contributions:<br /></strong>Once again, no source code is provided in this submission.<br /><br /><strong>Code Quality:<br /></strong>Not applicable.<br /><br /><strong>Applicability to other problems:<br /></strong>Once the authors develop a faster segmentation algorithm, it can presumably be used for segmentation in other large datasets.<br /><br /><strong>Suggestions for future work:<br /></strong>Not sure if this will help, but work&nbsp;by Abolmaesumi and Sirouspour on segmentation in medical images (particularly segmentation of the prostate in ultrasound images) may apply here - their algorithm is fast because it requires no numerical optimization.&nbsp; See &quot;Segmentation of prostate contours from ultrasound images&quot;, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing 2004, vol 3 pp 517-520, 2004; &quot;Ultrasound image segmentation using an interacting multiple-model probabilistic data association filter&quot;, Proceedings of the SPIE, vol 5370 pp 484-493, 2004; and &quot;An interacting multiple model probabilistic data association filter for cavity boundary extraction from ultrasound images&quot;, IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, vol 23(6) pp 772-782, 2004.<br /><br /><strong>Requests for additional information from authors:<br /></strong>1) The authors do not mention how molecular data (such as that from YFPs) is extracted from the in toto images - this presumably involves segmentation as well as further quantification.&nbsp; Has any of this work been done, or does it fall under future work? 2) Neither the segmentation algorithms nor the propagation algorithms used have been described in any detail - I am interested in what has been attempted so far.&nbsp; 3) How is the accuracy of the current segmentation algorithm quantified?&nbsp; The paper says that it is &quot;quite accurate&quot; but I would like to know how this has been determined.&nbsp; Also, the paper mentions that the current segmentation algorithm is slow - how much time does it take?&nbsp; 5)&nbsp; Although the advantages of incorporating use interaction into GoFigure are clear, I wonder how this works in practice.&nbsp; If the number of cells across space and time is as large as it seems to be, how much time does the user have to spend looking for false negatives and false positives?&nbsp; 6) More references on both in toto imaging and imaging for systems biology are needed so that the newcomer can see how this work fits into the rest of the field and how it is unique.<br /><br /><strong>Additional Comments:<br /></strong>1) The writing / English of this paper should be improved, particularly in Section 3.&nbsp; 2) Overall this is an excellent project - I&#39;m sure that plenty of systems biologists will be eager to get their hands on your software and data once it is released.&nbsp; Great work so far!</p><div>Score justification:<br /></div><p>1)&nbsp; (2 points) Does the paper follow the standards of open-science by including the relevant code, data, and parameters needed to replicate the work described in the paper? Can the work be duplicated? How well does the work (when appropriate) build upon (instead of duplicating) existing open-source efforts? </p><p>0 stars (because no code or data was provided in this submission)</p><p>2)&nbsp; (1 point) Does the work address a (knowledge or software-based) need within the community? Where do you see it having the most impact?</p><p>1 star - an open source&nbsp;software package for image-based systems biology is needed so that the difficult image processing work involved is not duplicated by researchers and so that biologists not explicitly trained in computer science can use the package and the associated data in their own work.</p><p>3)&nbsp; (1 point) How well is the work described in the paper? Is sufficient background material provided in the paper itself, or easily located using pointers in the paper? </p><p>1 star - the work is adequately described, and the background material is especially detailed.</p><p>4)&nbsp; (1 point) Can you name one or two research projects that you think would benefit from the use of this work?</p><p>1 star - the data provided by this work could definitely be used by bioinformaticians interested in reverse engineering of genetic networks, both to extract the underlying genetic circuits in zebrafish embryogenesis and as a test dataset to compare various reverse engineering algorithms.</p>",

The paper has not been updated to mention the availability of data, and the software remains unavailable.</p><p>The licensing terms of the software has not been identified. Additionally, it is limited to running on Windows at this time because of the use of MFC.</p><p>The authors are congratulated for making their data freely available. </p><p><strong>Reproducibility:</strong><br />Waiting for code release. Additionally, the paper is written at a higher level - more of an introductory text than a how-to text.<br /> <br /> <strong>Use of Open Source Software:</strong><br />Software uses ITK and VTK.</p><p><br /> <strong>Open Source Contributions:</strong><br />The license for the code is not given.</p><p>The data has been posted using a by-attribution license! </p><p> <strong>Applicability to other problems:</strong><br />This software way be generally applicable when 4D data needs to be quantified. The use of ITK suggests that other segmentations could be incorporated into the software. Also, the backend mysql database for managing images and analysis results should be generally useful. This software could evolve into a very useful toolkit.<br /><br /><strong>Suggestions for future work:</strong><br />1) Release the source</p><p>2) Go cross-platform</p><p>3) Release more data</p><p>4) Ensure mysql can handle the large images (some groups prefer PGSQL for large images).</p><p>5) Provide demonstrations and how-to text</p><p>6) Fix the spelling, grammar, and punctuation in the paper, particularly in the second half of the text. </p>",

Also included is software for a C++ interface to the robot.</p><p>This project builds upon the LEGO Mindstorm robot and the NXT++ library for controlling that robot. The tutorials and papers also refer to a 3D Slicer v3 module for IGT.</p><p>The paper also includes an excellent evaluation of the accuracy of the robot given repeated applications of the tutorial script. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Methods:</strong><br />The instructions for building the phantom is outstanding. I am confident that if I had the LEGO pieces, then I could build it.</p><p>The tutorials are extremely well written and illustrated. They seem to be viable for a wide range of ages and backgrounds. These tutorials exceed the standard for open-source teaching materials. Basic and advanced tutorials are presented.</p><p>The instructions for building the robot seem to be missing.</p><p>The instructions for accessing (i.e., the code for) the Slicer 3D module are missing. A Google search does not reveal the &quot;Lego Module&quot; for Slicer. As a result, the basic and advanced tutorials cannot be replicated. </p><p>The robot control software included with the tutorial is a modified version of the NXT++ library.<br />1) The authors have ported the NXT++ library to 64-bit linux systems which is important for IGT research/environments<br />2) The NXT++ library is GPL licensed and therefore the included code is GPL licensed, however those licensing terms are never given in the code.<br />3) The code claims to be copyrighted by the Insight Software Consortium - but it is not. A legitimate copyright needs to be declared.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Results:</strong><br />Once the missing pieces are provided (LEGO-pun intended), this tutorial will be the highlight of many high-school, college, graduate, and perhaps even medical school courses. </p><p>As the authors point out, the focus of the tutorials is not robot building, but instead it is on IGT theory (planning, calibration, registration, and control). The concepts of error measurement presented in the paper are also excellent companionS to the how-to nature of the tutorials. When those topics are to be discussed in a classroom, the tutorials discussed provide a unique hands-on / real-world method for conveying the key concepts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</p><p>The material provided sets a high standard for the presentation and evaluation of tutorial materials in a field (IGT) that desperately needs broadly useful educational materials. Furthermore, the use of LEGOs makes the tutorials cost effective and &quot;friendly&quot; to make IGT more accessible.</p><p>The absence of two key pieces (robot building instructions and the Slicer module) inhibit the actual use of the tutorial material, but hopefully the authors can quickly correct this oversight. </p>",

     "content": "<strong>Summary:</strong><br />The authors propose to speed up the implementation of ITKs registration framework both through code optmizations and multithreading. ITKs registration framework is - or perhaps I should say was - regrettably slow. This paper is an excellent and much needed contribution. <br /><br />If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, the authors should know that I am planning to reimplement much of my own work using the ideas and framework presented here.<br /><br /><strong>Evidence:</strong><br />The majority of the evidence presented is in the form of timing comparisons on two machines. Unfortunately, there are several different speed up methods at work here. It is difficult to discern from the evidence, which code changes are more important. In my reproduction of the work (see below) I noted that there are speedups of both the metric evaluations, and the metric initialization. This is of course good, but this might merit separate analysis.<br /><br /><strong>Open Science:</strong><br />The work adheres to the principles of open science. However - the work was somewhat difficult to reproduce. Recently the code was added to the ITK CVS, which made access to it much easier. However, it was added in such a way that an ITKCVS build seems to either use these classes, or the original versions, but not both. At least, it appears this way - in all honesty i did not try to build them from the Review directory, but came up with my own way. Details follow below. <br /><br /><strong>Reproducibility:</strong><br />I got the code working in nearly its original form. Very significant speedup was immediately apparent, plus of course the new capability of multithreading. As this is a new framework for (mainly) the ITK registration metrics, i implemented some of my own work in this framework. This was not possible to do easily from the document - it was only possible after carefully reading the code.<br /><br />A careful testing approach is essential for any large code optimization project like this. The approach described in the paper seems good. However, I did not reproduce it. The current set up in the ITK CVS seems to preclude testing the old against the new versions of metrics unless one is willing to build two concurrent ITK installs. Even then, how one could write a single program to run one metric, then the other and compare their output was not obvious. I did it my own way see below.<br /><br /><strong>Use of Open Source Software / Open Source Contributions:</strong><br />It is a contribution to the open source ITK project.<br /><br /><strong>Code Quality:</strong><br />The code is of high quality. However, there are three design criticisms that i might make<br />1. A not insignificant part of the speed is due to using memset instead of the Fill() methods. Perhaps the Fill methods should be recoded to use memset instead? Then the speed benefit would appear everywhere that uses them.<br /><br />2. The code for the threaded GetValue and GetValueAndDerivative methods is complex and highly repetitive. As we all know, repetitive code is hard to maintain. I think that the repetition could be reduced somewhat. In particular, i found it possible to compress both the Transform point methods into one. I found other ways of reducing the amount of repeated code in my re-implementation by using a recursive including scheme, but this did make it a bit more difficult to understand. <br /><br />3. The caching of the bspline parameters does give a significant speedup, but at the cost of a MASSIVE use of memory. For any interesting size 3D image, and even many 2D images, it is completely impossible to run this on a 32-bit system. I think there should be a switch to turn this on or off. Yes it runs slower, but its still useful to run it on 32-bit systems on medium size images.<br /><br />Requests for additional information from authors:<br />I think that additional documentation is needed. Not all the modified classes are described, or even listed, in the text. <br />In particular, i found the way the multithreading is actually implemented, and what a user must implement to reproduce their own metric, would benefit from a written thorough explanation. I had to read the code - very carefully - to figure it out.<br /><br />It would also be interesting to have a list of what is different about all the optimized classes. Some independent testing might be valuable. For example, how much of the speed up is due to the interpolator, and how much to the metric? What is the optimized resample filter, it is not discussed in the text.<br /><br />It seems to me that the efficiency of these methods is highly reliant on inlining, especially of the ThreadProcessSample function. This would be interesting to explore. If inlineing is not vital, function pointers could be used, which could simplify the code, i think. On the other hand, if inlining is important, perhaps the transform point method (also called for every pixel) could be inlined. <br /><br />I was curious about the authors thoughts of existing shared memory parallelization methods, in particular openMP, as a way of getting quick multithread gains for low coding effort. This was more a vague thought, than a specific request. Clearly many of the compilers on which ITK is built do not support openMP, so it may not have universal applicability.<br /><br /><strong>Additional Comments:</strong><br /><br /><em>How I reproduced (some of) the work.</em><br /><br />I was using the version in the ITK CVS as of Feb 6, 2008. The rest of the code besides the review directory was ITK 3.4. The optimized classes are intended to replace the nonoptimized classes of the same name - therefore building both alongside each other is difficult. I first renamed all the optimized classes to have the prefix &quot;opt&quot; on their names. I then made the OptImageToImageMetric a subclass of ImageToImageMetric - this way i could plug it into existing code.<br /><br />I trusted the optimized interpolators, so i just began using them directly.<br /><br />I evaluated the metrics a number of times with the old metric implementation, and the new metric implementation, and compared the results. The mean squares metric is numerically identical to the old one. The MI metric is numerically very similar, but not identical. Both optimized metrics are MUCH faster, running single threaded. This is not due to the interpolators - during this test both metrics were using the same interpolators. The metric code itself is significantly more efficient.<br /><br />Running multithreaded, contrary to what is described in the text, I actually found further performance increases (although not even close to linear) running more threads than cores. Specifically 3 threads on a two core machine was noticably better than two. This was a Windows XP 32bit machine, compiler Visual C++ 2003. Its probably some quirk of windows.<br /><br />I did not evaluate the oriented image gradient fix - i have my own way of doing this, discussed elsewhere.<br /><br />I did not evaluate the optimized resample image filter.<br /><br />As a further evaluation of the work, I reimplemented one of my own metrics copying most of the ideas from this framework. I found that it was not too difficult to do, but does require a careful reading of the code - more documentation would have been helpful. The study of the code probably took me a days work. The implementation about 4 hours, and theres still a bug or two to track down. Nevertheless, i conclude that the framework is usable and general and strikes a reasonable balance between efficiency and intelligibility. As mentioned, I did find that the code might be difficult to maintain, due to repetition.<br /><br /><em>Things that may be bugs or errors:</em><br /><br />In the paper (p. 4) it says that the base itkTransform class was modified for thread safety. However, in the ITK CVS Review versions, there is no modified version of itkTransformBase. Furthermore, the classes seem to achieve thread safety by making multiple copies of the transform.<br />------<br />In Figure three, supposedly the old method is being compared to the new method. In the text it is claimed the new method is 6 times faster when run single threaded (probably true, based on my experience). However, the graph starts at 1. I dont think it graphs the right thing.<br />-------<br />in itkOptImageToImageMetric.txx<br /><br /> // If user provided a mask over the Moving image<br /> if ( m_MovingImageMask )<br /> {<br /> // Check if mapped point is within the support region of the moving image<br /> // mask<br /> sampleOk = m_MovingImageMask-&gt;IsInside( mappedPoint );<br /> }<br /> else<br /> {<br /> // Check if mapped point inside image buffer<br /> sampleOk = m_Interpolator-&gt;IsInsideBuffer( mappedPoint );<br /> }<br /> <br />I think that being inside the moving image mask does not guarantee that the point is inside the valid region of the moving image. I think both tests should be done.<br />-------<br />There is a minor inconsistency in that the stub for ThreadPostProcess is placed in the header, and the stubs for the other two are in the .txx<br />-------<br /><br /> <br /> ",

The paper listed for citation [Rohlfing, 2003] in the paper is very likely the wrong one. The correct one should probably be T. Rohlfing and C. R. Maurer, Jr., &ldquo;Nonrigid image registration in shared-memory multiprocessor environments with application to brains, breasts, and bees,&rdquo; <em>IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine</em>, vol. 7, no. 1, pp. 16-25, 2003.</p><p><strong>Observations regarding the techniques: </strong></p><p>1. I am very concerned by the use of sparse image sampling in nonrigid registration. I do not trust probabilistic sampling schemes for local deformations, and I doubt it is necessary when the algorithm is otherwise optimized.</p><p>2. Without any consideration as to whether any of these can be easily implemented in the current framework, I would like to mention a number of optimizations that I have found very effective in my own code:</p><ol><li> Each control point of the B-spline transformation effects only a small neighborhood, and gradients can be computed using finite differences by only recomputing the metric contribution of that local region. This leads to computational performance increase of several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, all three degrees of freedom of the same control point (its x,y,z position) effect the same subvolume, so the &quot;baseline&quot; metric of the remaining, unaffected volume can be used three times. </li><li>The B-spline transformation can be computed very efficiently (50% faster) using a scanline algorithm. The control point grid is aligned with the reference image grid, so all pixels within one x image row share the same relative y and z coordinate in the control point grid row and plane. These relative positions are also invariant under changes of the control point positions, so they can be computed once when the transformation object is created. Moreover, all pixels within the same control point cell receive the same contributions from the B-spline basis functions in y and z. So two out of three nested sums in the B-spline formula can be precomputed for all pixels in a given cell. The same observations hold for computing analytical derivatives (e.g., for bending energy and Jacobian matrices).<br /></li><li>The affine pre-registration transformation can be included in the B-spline transformation by interpreting the B-spline output as the transformed vector, rather than as an offset vector. Then, the affine transformation can simply be applied to the control point positions.</li><li>It is not necessarily necessary to have each thread work on a separate copy of the B-spline transformation for finite difference gradient approximation. If local computation of the metric changes (see Item 2.1 above) is used, than degrees of freedom that affect control points separated by more than 4 steps in any direction are entirely independent of each other. One could, therefore, order the control points into a &quot;schedule&quot; in which the next control point is always at least 4 grid steps away from the previous. Such a schedule has a &quot;maximally safe concurrent computation range&quot; associated with it that specifies how many successive control points from the schedule can be moved without affecting one another&#39;s local neighborhoods. This is also the number of parallel threads that can work along the schedule concurrently using the same B-spline parameter array without interfering with each other. The advantage of this technique is that it avoids duplication of the (potentially large) array of B-spline parameters. The downside is that it doesn&#39;t scale as well to larger numbers of CPUs (more than about 3 actually in my experience), although scaling improves as the number of control points increases. I myself have abandoned this idea again, but I thought I&#39;d mention it.</li><li>The paper mentions the possibility of excluding &quot;background&quot; control points from optimization to reduce the number of degrees of freedom and increase performance. There are at least two difference ways to achieve this, and I wanted to comment on the two: the first is &quot;static&quot; in the sense that it analyzes the image data to determine image background (described in Rohlfing et al., MICCAI 2001), the second is more &quot;dynamic&quot; in that it looks at the full cost function gradient and deactivates the control points with low gradient contributions (this was done by Schnabel, Tanner, Rueckert around the same time, but I don&#39;t have the references handy right now). I used to think that the second way was better, because it is more directly related to the gradient, whereas the image background detection is a bit removed from the optimization process. After playing with both techniques, however, I concluded that the static image analysis is preferable (at least for me), especially for large problems (think: groupwise registration), because it does not require to ever compute the full cost function gradient using all degrees of freedom. In cases where the cost of the full gradient is prohibitive, you can still get away very well with the static image background detection in the images themselves. </li></ol><p><strong>Other observations:</strong></p><p> I will go and rummage through my code to check for any other optimizations I may have forgotten about.</p><p> Once I manage to build the new ITK tools, I will perform an direct comparison of my own B-spline with the new one to see how their performance compares. </p>",

     "content": "<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br /> this paper report the first results of a multithreaded implementation of the ITK registration framework. Dedicated metrics and test environment has been developed to compare the new implementation with the previous one on different plateforms, with different environments and depending on the number of thread used.<br /> <br /> <strong>Hypothesis:</strong><br /> * multicore/multi cpu are ubiquitous or about to be (85% of intel CPU are currently at least dual core).<br /> * using all the core/cpu should improve the performances<br /> * the improvment should happen across plateform and OSes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Evidence:</strong><br /> The speed comparison depending on the number of thread have been plotted and illustrate the gain. Example are multiple and show clearly that users will gain from using the new implementation, whatever filter/metric/oprtimizer they use in the registration framework and whatever plateform they are working on. That was the main target of the work, and we can say: Work well done!<br /> Note: It seems that part of the gain was made from code optimisation and not multihreading. <br /> </p><p>It seems that using more threads is interesting as long as the number of threads is not greater than the number of cores/CPU. If the number of thread is higher, we see the performance decrease. It would be nice to have the filters decide ow many thread they want to use automatically. It does not seems to be consistent enough across platforms or threading implementation to be able to do so. Another point not discussed on the paper but discussed intensively on the itk-develloper mailin glist is that it depends on the multithreading implementation: does the filter creates and destroy threads, or does it access a pool of shared threads? This question is under investigation.</p><p>One very interesting part of the work is the implementation of the cross-platform multithreading testing and benchmarking tool. Mixing BatchMake and CMake seems to provide good results. It would be interesting in the future to use this tool for other multithreading implementations (the Mesh part of ITK would be my first target, but I&#39;m kind of biased). The authors also experiment a lot with different profiling tools and timing tools, I think many users would be interested in knowing which tools they used (they mention valgrind, but I suppose they mean cachegrind), what kind of experiment they did and what ther conclusion were about the pros and the cons of each tools. That is outside the scope of this paper, but that would make a great wiki page. <br /> </p><p><strong>Open Science:</strong><br />In ITK spirit, the author provide the code under BSD and the IJ article under CC. The code should be integrated in ITK post 3.4 release. It must be noted that modification of this magnitude can not be integrated in ITK at once. The quality process, that insure that the code is stable on an almost daily basis prevent that from happening.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>Reproducibility:</strong><br /> Checking out an older version of ITK, i could compile it and run a basic test. The amount of work needed to reproduce the result was such that I did not even try. Teh current version does not compile, but it should be only a matter of weeks before it is available in the CVS version of ITK.<br /> <br /> <strong>Use of Open Source Software:</strong><br />ITK</p><p> <strong>Open Source Contributions:</strong><br />integration in ITK in progress.</p><p><strong>Code Quality:</strong><br />Master Luis checked it, it should be good. Test are provided. Along the main line of work , the authors took the time to profile the application and found many improvements, not only on speed, but also on combinaitions of filters/metrics/optimizers that had never been tested together before and happened not to work along well. I guess a complete matrix test using all the possible combinations is being developped right now. It should find a lot of potential bugs an improve the overall quality of the registration framework. Thank you for that. </p><p><strong>Applicability to other problems:</strong><br />the multithreading test framework could be reused for other part of ITK, or for any multithreaded code that use CMake, I guess.<br /> A little report on the timing and profiling tools would be of interest.<br /> <br /><br /> <strong>Suggestions for future work:</strong><br />* threading implementation and other issues are being investigated and (intensely) discussed right now.<br /> * better and more complete registration framework tests are being developed.<br /> </p><p>It would be interesting to have results on realy big cases (zebrafish datasets ...) to check if you really have much better improvement in this case as you are expecting. In that case, it would also make the thread pool model more interesting. </p><p>You report that threads and associated items (mutex) implementation on SunOS were especially slow, and I noticed that the SunOS machine used for your test were using sunOS 5.8. It so happen that the SUN threading library is known to be horribly slow, untill sun decided to completely rewrite it. The new library was shipped separatly one year after the release of sunOS 5.8, so your machine might not have it installed. With the current OpenSolaris (or the latest release of 5.10) you should have much better results. I was wondering, out of pure curiosity, what the results would be on one of their &quot;Niagara&quot; box which is optimized for multithreading operations.<br /> <br /><br /> <strong>Requests for additional information from authors:</strong><br />It&#39;s a work on progress. I wil ljust wait for the results. Everything is really interesting indeed.<strong><br /> </strong></p>",

     "content": "Overall Review:<br />The algorithm implemented through this paper is of great utility to the medical imaging community. It is implemented in ITK, which means that it will be accessible to a very large user base. A great amount of effort was placed to provide an efficient implementation of the algorithm along with two different transformation models. Their experimental results, while limited, provide sufficient evidence for the correctness of their implementation.<br /><br />Summary: <br />This paper experiments with a new transformation model based on B-splines for an existing joint alignment algorithm. Using the Jacobian of the deformation field within a stochastic optimization framework (in a multi-resolution setting) an efficient implementation of this algorithm is derived. The authors provide an open source implementation of the algorithm and their transformations using ITK. They provide basic experimental results on synthetic data to validate the correctness of their implementation and the similarity in results between affine registration and B-spline registration. <br /><br />Hypothesis: <br />B-splines have not yet been tested as a deformation model within existing Groupwise Registration algorithms. The implicit hypothesis in this work is that the use of B-splines is advantageous, at least for the type of data tested here. <br /><br />However, the major contribution of this work is providing an efficient open source implementation of the Groupwise Registration algorithm that can be used with either affine transformations or B-spline based transformations. <br /><br />Evidence: <br />The authors did not explicitly state that B-spline registration is better or worse than affine registration. No direct, quantitative analysis was performed to show which type of registration worked better. Visually, the results are very similar and it is not clear if B-spline registration provides any advantages over affine registration. Also, the experimental results are somewhat weak since they are based on synthetic data. Especially since the synthetic volumes are created by randomly transforming the same original volume. <br /><br />However, their results do confirm that their implementation of the algorithm using either transformation model is correct. In all 4 experiments, the algorithm produced significantly sharper mean images and an almost black STD image. <br /><br />I disagree that a black STD image is sufficient evidence for a perfect registration (as stated in page 7). One needs to also compare the mean image to the original image used before any random transformations were applied. That way we can ensure that the algorithm is not creating data. The extreme case is if the algorithm changed all the images to purely white, then the STD image will be black but the mean image will be far from reality. <br /><br />Open Science: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />This paper adheres strongly to the concept of open science. The authors provide an open source implementation of the algorithm and do a good job at describing it. They also provide all experiment parameters and the data used for their experiments. The experiments can easily be replicated by following the steps in Section 5 of the paper. <br /><br />Reproducibility: <br />I downloaded and viewed the provided code but did not attempt to compile it. By viewing the code and my basic understanding of ITK it seems as though one can reproduce the results by simply installing the necessary packages and running a provided script (as outlined in Section 5).<br />&nbsp;<br />Use of Open Source Software: <br />The authors used ITK to implement their algorithm. They did not provide any specific information regarding ITK with respect to its advantages, disadvantages or hints for users. However, ITK is a widely used open source package for registration, I am not sure that such information was necessary. Of course any important information specific to the classes they implemented might have been worth mentioning.<br />&nbsp;<br />Open Source Contributions: <br />The authors provide their code along with a helpful description on how to use it. Since it was implemented using ITK it is in usable form. I have not attempted to use it.<br />&nbsp;<br />Code Quality: <br />Their code is easy to read and since it was implemented with ITK, they followed all the guidelines and good code design enforced by ITK. <br />&nbsp;<br />Applicability to other problems: <br />Groupwise image registration is a very important problem in medical imaging. A large number of researchers will find this implementation of great value.<br /><br />Suggestions for future work: <br /><br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; More extensive experiments using real data<br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; A study to compare B-spline registration to affine registration<br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Provide run time information for the experiments<br />&nbsp;<br />Requests for additional information from authors: <br />None.<br />&nbsp;<br />Additional Comments: <br />The authors did not give a reason for extending previous work to include B-spline registration. It is not clear from their results if B-spline registration is better or even faster than affine registration. Filling in these gaps would make the paper much more complete.<br />",

   "abstract": "Richard Beare has recently introduced a new filter to efficiently labelize the connected components with ITK, and has also proposed to use the run-length encoding used in that filter to implement some of the most useful binary mathematical morphology operators: the opening by attribute. Following that idea, and after have searched a way to use the ITK's spatial objects for this task, a new set of classes have been developed to represent and manipulate the label images and the objects within them in ITK.\r\nThose new classes have been used to implement several label images manipulation based on object attributes, as well as the binary and label specialization of some mathematical morphology filters based on the morphological reconstruction. This contribution comes with 65 new classes, and should greatly enhance the binary mathematical\r\nmorphology in ITK.\r\n\r\nAll the source codes are provided, as well as a full set of tests and several usage examples of the new classes.\r\n",

   "abstract": "We present an open-source ITK implementation of a direct Fourier method for tomographic reconstruction, applicable to parallel-beam x-ray images. Direct Fourier reconstruction makes use of the central-slice theorem to build a polar 2D Fourier space from the 1D transformed projections of the scanned object, that is resampled into a Cartesian grid. Inverse 2D Fourier transform eventually yields the reconstructed image. Additionally, we provide a complex wrapper to the BSplineInterpolateImageFunction to overcome ITK\u2019s current lack for image interpolators dealing with complex data types. A sample application is presented and extensively illustrated on the Shepp-Logan head phantom. We show that appropriate input zeropadding and 2D-DFT oversampling rates together with radial cubic b-spline interpolation improve 2D-DFT interpolation quality and are efficient remedies to reduce reconstruction artifacts.",

Furthermore, general\r\ncode that uses the itk::OrientedImage will suffer an unnecessary penalty when the image is oriented\r\nparallel to the image axes.

     "content": "<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br />The authors propose a new image class that takes into account an orientation matrix in addition to a diagonal spacing matrix and an origin point. The aim is to optimize the conversion of points and gradients between pixel space and physical space in the most commonly used cases. The focus is on providing a solution that is generic enough to cover all possible cases. This topic is very important for registration problems where the conversion can be needed millions of times. The solution proposed by the authors is based on function pointers.</p><p>Overall I think it is a good approach. I would suggest using this idea in the basic itk::Image class and deprecate the itk::OrientedImage class. </p><p> <br /> <strong>Hypothesis:</strong><br />I fully agree with the hypothesis made by the authors:<br />1) Most ITK users will typically use images with a simple combination of orientation matrix, spacing vector and origin<br />2) Many users will need non trivial orientation matrices<br />3) All users care about the performance of registration </p><p> <br /> <strong>Evidence:</strong><br />The authors claim that their solution:<br />1) is as generic as the oriented image class<br />2) can deal with the orientation of gradients<br />3) is often even more efficient than the standard image class<br />55 timing tests are provided to support the author claims. </p><p><br /> <strong>Open Science:</strong><br />The paper fully adheres to the open science concept. The code, the testing framework and the data are provided. The code uses only ITK.</p><p><strong><br />Reproducibility:<br /></strong>I have been able to reproduce the authors work. The only thing I needed to change was a #define SPEEDTESTNUM which by default was set to a ridiculously low value and did not allow me to compare the time taken by the different implementations. On my platform (ubuntu, x86, gcc 4.1.2), the authors fast implementation compared even better with respect to the standard image class.</p><p>A very small README file would be useful to tell the reader what the log files refer to.<br /> </p><p><br /> <strong>Use of Open Source Software:</strong><br />The work uses ITK. The author give a brief comparison of their approach to gradient orientation problems with the one being proposed by the ITK team.</p><p><strong>Open Source Contributions:</strong><br />It took me very little time to compile and run the tests.</p><p><br /> <strong>Code Quality:</strong><br />The code needs a little cleanup to give it a consistent indentation, move out the #define printouts and so on. In itkFastOrientedImage.h a few #include are nor necessary. </p><p> <br /> <strong>Applicability to other problems:</strong><br />The idea of using function pointers to use specialized optimized functions could be used in many ITK classes. A lot of filters could be optimized if, during their initialization, a function pointer was set to point to an efficient specialized function. </p><p> <br /> <strong>Suggestions for future work:</strong><br />As mentioned by the authors, the use of function pointers forbids the compiler to inline the function. This has a performance price. The author claim that using specialized template classes would lead to an even better performance. This approach is however less generic than the previous one as it has to be decided at compile-time rather than run-time. For some users, compile-time may be fine. It would thus be great to include for example a very basic image class that only allows for unit orientation, unit spacing and zero origin. This would prove the author claim and let the user decide whether the added performance is worth the loss of genericness.</p><p>Many specific cases are not addressed. If the orientation matrix (including spacing or not) is composed of only 1s and -1s, optimized version can also be designed. It would be nice to have all those specialized versions, even though it becomes tricky :)<br /><br /> <br /> <strong>Additional Comments:</strong><br />In the current constructor, the orientation and spacing are set to the identity and the origin is set to zero but the function pointers are set to the generic cases. I would be more consistent and make more sense to point to the specialized version.</p><p>The authors claim that &quot;there is no point implementing a set of functions for TransformPhysicalPointToIndex&quot;. At first this puzzled me. It would be clearer to say something like &quot;there is no point implementing a set of specialized functions for TransformPhysicalPointToIndex because the generic one cannot really be improved.&quot;</p><p>In the code, I saw:<br /> // cast to integer is really really slow... maybe rewrite in assembly later.<br />#define RealToInt(A) static_cast(A)<br />A first improvement may come from using vcl functions. Then it might be worth looking at how this issue is addressed in the BSplineInterpolator. See http://www.itk.org/Bug/view.php?id=2078 for a discussion of its accuracy.<br /> </p>",

   "abstract": "This presentation is a satire of the current obsession with intellectual property, innovation and originality that plagues the field of medical image analysis.\r\n\r\nThe presentation makes the point that most Journals and Conferences focus on Originality and despise Reproducibility and Verification, demonstrating great disrespect for the essential elements of the scientific method. The practice of \\\"peer-review\\\" is offered in most cases as an insufficient substitute for the actual verification of reproducibility.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, this presentation intends to brings awareness to the fact that authors of papers are treated by Publishers as if they were writers of Novels instead as reporters of scientific findings. In that confusion, authors are required to be \\\"original\\\" (as if they were writing Novels or Plays) instead of being required to report \\\"reproducible\\\" findings. Such practice obliterates critical thinking and erodes the basic principles of the scientific community.",

   "abstract": "Parameterization of surfaces, sometimes alled \u201d\u2018flattening\u201d\u2019 as it maps a surface embedded in 3D into its intrinsic 2D domain, is a powerfull tool for the analysis of surfaces. For the past years, there has been a growing interest in the Community that even lead to one implementation of one special type of parameterization in ITK [1,5,8,9]. We are providing here a more general framework for parameterization of single connected surfaces of any genus. It is based on a recent addition to ITK: itkQuadEdgeMesh [6] which allows an elegant an optimal implementation of algorithm for geometry and topology processing of discrete 2-manifolds. The 5 algorithms that we implemented map the meshes into a planar domain with fixed boundary leading to more stability and speed than mapping into the spherical domain. Each of them use different kind of parameterization with different properties. The conformal parameterization is usually used as it is intrinsic to the geometry of the mesh and thus allow shape analysis independently of the connectivity. However if flattening the mesh is your only goal, then the simplest parameterization algorithm (graph theory) will give you the best speed. This is the case when you want to further process the mesh in a lower dimension. Using specific solvers, the parameterization of meshes can be done sufficiently fast (couple of seconds) to consider this approach in interactive applications.",

The iterator is initialized at known seed points and starting from these, neighbors that are within the desired connectivity are marked as to be visited and processed by the iterator in the future.\r\n\r\nThe FloodFilledFunctionConditionalConstIterator builds the foundation for the implementation of the NeighborhoodConnectedImageFilter and is currently fixed to investigating 4-neighborhoods in 2D and 6-neighborhoods in 3D. Since many existing applications use region growing algorithms that perform on full neighborhoods (i.e. 8-connected in 2D and 26-connected in 3D) it is desirable to be able to choose at least between these two standard connectivities.\r\n\r\nIn this document we describe the extension of the existing iterator to be using ShapedNeighborhoodIterators which has already been proposed in the implementation of the FloodFilledFunctionConditionalConstIterator.",

   "abstract": "A novel platform for realizing software prototypes in the area of medical image processing, analysis and visualization is introduced: The \\\"Medical Image Processing Platform\\\" (MIPP). A novel feature is the combination of ITK/VTK with Java/Eclipse RCP, four potential technologies complementing each other. While ITK and VTK provide comprehensive functionality for image processing and visualization, Java and Eclipse RCP facilitate the development of a modern and rich application.\r\n\r\nRCP offers everything for creating plug-in based software. The benefits of integrating ITK and VTK in such a modular architecture are reusability and extensibility. Functionality usually found in software for medical image processing and visualization (2D and 3D viewers, DICOM and application data management, etc.) is provided by the MIPP platform as plug-ins, can be easily reused by new applications and needn\\'t be re-implemented. Developers can extend the platform\\'s features by contributing new plug-ins and, again, make these available for others.\r\n\r\nThe paper describes the architecture of the MIPP platform and outlines its most important functionality. Finally, three clinical software systems implemented with MIPP are presented.",

The combination of PET and CT images offers complementary functional and anatomical information. The application (FusionViewer) facilitates efficient visualization and analysis of PET/CT studies via different viewing modes (linked cursor display, alpha-blend mode, checkerboard mode and split window mode). FusionViewer is implemented in Java and uses the Java OpenGL (JOGL) library and the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK) library, which make it both a fast and cross-platform application. Its intuitive graphical user interface makes it easy to be used by physicians, radiologists, and research scientists. Several analysis and display tools are already available (navigator, zoom, pan, screen snapshot, ROI, and line measure tool; alpha-blending, checkerboard display, and split window display). Along with PET/CT, several other modalities where co-registered images are often visualized simultaneously have benefited from the use of this software.",

   "abstract": "ly in ITK, the only way to find the contour of the objects in a binary image is to use the BinaryErodeImageFilter, with a kernel of radius 1. This filter is a generic filter, made to support any shape and size of structuring element, and thus is not optimized for the particular case needed to detect the contours. Moreover, that filter is not multithreaded, so it can't get the performance improvements allowed by the multiprocessor systems. As a result, the contour detection can be quite time consuming currently -- for example, in SignedMaurerDistanceMapImageFilter, the contour detection takes about 33% of the execution time.\r\nThis contribution comes with a new filter which highly improve the performance of the contour detection in the binary image, and a second filter which allow the detection of the countours in label images with similar performance.",

   "abstract": "We present and implement an error estimation protocol in the Insight Toolkit (ITK) for assessing the\r\naccuracy of image alignment. We base this error estimation on a robust version of the HausdorffDistance\r\n(HD) metric applied to the recovered edges of the images. The robust modifications we introduce to\r\nthe HD metric significantly reduce the amount of outliers in the local distance error estimation. We\r\nevaluate the accuracy of our protocol on synthetically deformed images. We provide the source code\r\nand datasets to reproduce this evaluation. The proposed method is shown to improve error assessment\r\nwhen it is compared with conventional HD methods. This approach has many applications including\r\nlocal estimation and visual assessment of registration error and registration parameter selection.",

   "abstract": "Semi-automatic image segmentation algorithms depend on interaction with the user to accurately define a region of interest within an image. Once such method is a dynamic programming approach called {em Intelligent Scissors} developed by Mortenson and Barret cite{Mortensen1992,Mortensen1995,Barrett1996,Barrett1997}. Standard interaction involves the user-placement of a seed point on or near the boundary of the object to be extracted. Using a gradient-based cost function, a {em live-wire} image path from the seed point to a subsequently placed boundary point is determined. As this free point is manipulated with the mouse cursor, the live-wire boundary, which extends from the seed point to the varying free point, locks onto nearby edges within the image. Although some applications do not require such user-interaction (e.g. cite{Hu2001}) warranting inclusion within the toolkit, incorporating live-wire capabilities into ITK-SNAP cite{Yushkevich2006} has been discussed and, therefore, we would like to, as a preliminary step, vet the code within the ITK community.",

It is already a good thing to have this unit test but I would recommend increasing the testing coverage.

   "abstract": "When dealing with functional minimization, or maximization, it can sometimes be solved by a greedy algorithm. To implement greedy algorithm one needs priority queue container, i.e. get for a very low cost the lowest or highest element present in a sorted container. Whenever the priority of one element present in the queue needs to be modified, standard implementations, like \\code{std::priority\\_queue}, can not be applied directly. VTK has is own implementation \\code{vtkPriorityQueue} which is not templated and can only be applied for \\code{vtkIdType} and for the minimizing the functional. We propose here an implementation of a mutable priority queue container where element, priority, and objective (minimization or maximization) are given by template arguments. Our implementation allows to minimize or maximize a given functional, and any element can be modified, deleted at any time, and with a low cost.",

   "abstract": "noindent This document describes two new classes that facilitate the use of\r\nthe doxygen{BSplineDeformableTransform} in multiresolution registration\r\nalgorithms. The first class, doxygen{GridScheduleComputer}, defines the\r\nB-spline grid, based on a user-specified grid spacing and an input image (the\r\nfixed image in registration). A different grid is determined for each\r\nresolution level of the registration, given a multiresolution schedule similar\r\nto that of the image pyramids. The second class,\r\ndoxygen{UpsampleBSplineParametersFilter}, resamples (usually upsamples) the\r\nB-spline coefficients to a new control point grid having a different\r\nspacing/origin/size. This can be used to transfer the result from one\r\nresolution level to that of the next level. Summarising, suitable grid\r\ndefinitions follow from the first class, and are used as input for the second\r\nclass, which performs the actual resampling.\r\n\r\nThe classes are implemented using the Insight Toolkit url{www.itk.org}. This\r\npaper is accompanied with the source code, including a test program.",

   "abstract": "Although greyscale intensity values are primarily used in image data visualization oftentimes, due to the requirements of aesthetics (whether they be self-imposed or collaborator-suggested), mapping the greyscale image to a user-defined colormap is desired. In this paper, we propose a framework for inclusion in the ITK library for converting intensity-valued images to user-defined RGB colormap images. We also include several colormaps that can be readily applied for visualization of images in such programs as ITK-SNAP or can be used as examples for creating new colormaps.",

   "abstract": "Many image registration algorithms are formulated as optimization \r\nproblems with a gradient descent based solver, One difficulty with \r\ndesigning and implementing such methods is in the implementation of \r\nthe gradient computation. This process can be time-consuming and \r\nerror-prone. In addition some functions do not have gradients that can \r\nbe expressed in symbolic form. Automatic differentiation is useful for \r\ncomputing gradients of complicated objective functions. It moves the \r\nburden of computing gradients from the programmer to the computer. So \r\nfar, AD has not been exploited for use in image registration. This \r\npaper describes a software library the authors have developed to \r\nautomate the process of computing gradients of registration objective \r\nfunctions.

   "abstract": "When dealing with meshes, it is often preferable to work with a lower resolution mesh for computational\ntime purpose, display. The process of reducing a given mesh, mesh decimation, is thus an important step\nin most of pipeline dealing with meshes. Incremental decimation algorithms, the most popular ones,\nconsists of iteratively removing one point of the mesh, by Euler operations such as vertex removal or\nedge collapse. Here we focus on edge collapse based decimation approaches and propose a general\nframework based on a surface mesh data structure (itk::QuadEdgeMesh [3]). Our implementation intends\nto be as general and as flexible as possible. Indeed it can theoretically be applied on any polygonal\nmesh1; the measure, functional to be optimized at each iteration, the objective to be reached, and optional\nmethods like point relocation to enhance the geometry of the resulting mesh, are given by the user.\nWe provide here two specific implementations: itk::QuadEdgeMeshSquaredEdgeLengthDecimation\nand itk::QuadEdgeMeshQuadricDecimation, that could be used as example to implement additional\nalgorithms.",

   "abstract": "Computing local curvatures of a given surface is important for applications, shape analysis, surface segmentation, meshing, and surface evolution. For a given smooth surface (with a given analytical expression which is sufficiently differentiable) curvatures can be analytically and directly computed. However in real applications, one often deals with a surface mesh which is an insufficiently differentiable approximation, and thus curvatures must be estimated. Based on a surface mesh data structure (\\code{itk::QuadEdgeMesh}~\\cite{itkQE}), we introduce and implement curvature estimators following the approach of Meyer\\etal\\cite{Meyer02}. We show on a sphere that this method results in more stable curvature approximations than the commonly used discrete estimators (as used in VTK: \\code{vtkCurvatures}).",

   "abstract": "A novel point-set registration algorithm was proposed in [6] based on minimization of the Jensen-Shannon divergence. In this contribution, we generalize this Jensen-Shannon divergence point-set measure framework to the Jensen-Havrda-Charvat-Tsallis divergence. This generalization permits a \ufb01ne-tuning of the actual divergence measure between robustness and speci\ufb01city. The principle contribution of this submission is theitk::JensenHavrdaCharvatTsallisPointSetMetric class which is derived from the existing itk::PointSetToPointSetMetric. In addition, we provide other classes with utility that would extend beyond the point-set measure framework that we provide in this paper. This includes a point-set analogue of the itk::ImageFunction, i.e. itk::PointSetFunction. From this class we derive the class itk::ManifoldParzenWindowsPointSetFunction which provides a Parzen windowing scheme for learning the local structure of point-sets. Finally, we include the \r\nitk::DecomposeTensorFunction class which wraps the different vnl matrix decomposition schemes for easy use within ITK. \r\n",

   "abstract": "Graph-based algorithms have enjoyed renewed interest for solving computer vision problems. These algorithms have been the subject of intense interest and research. In order to maintain the ITK library au courant, we developed a framework for graph-based methods of energy minimization in ITK which employ energy functions derived within a Markov Random Field (MRF) context. This required not only the implementation of the energy minimization methodology but also the more general requirement of introducing graph-related data structures into ITK which can be used for other graph-based algorithms pertinent to future extensions of the ITK library. \r\n\r\nPlease note that some of the algorithms described in this paper may be covered by patents and, as such, it is incumbent upon the user to seek licenses before building the binaries which utilize this code.

   "abstract": "In a surgical environment, there are many tools and objects (including the patient) being used. In a computer-aided surgery, the position of each of these tools in the operating room is very critical and generally will be tracked in their own coordinate systems. To show the surgeon a real time picture of the operating environment on a computer monitor, we need to know the position of each object with respect to one common coordinate system, which in turn can be achieved by knowing each coordinate system and the transforms between them. Image-Guided Surgical Toolkit is a software toolkit designed to enable biomedical researchers to rapidly prototype and create new applications for image-guided surgery. In IGSTK, in which the coordinate systems and the transforms are being successfully used, there is no central data structure or repository, which will hold all the coordinate systems and the transforms between them. Such a data structure could help the IGSTK software developers to have more confidence in the code they have written. This project develops a tool, which will create such a data structure and dynamically show the changes to it, to help such software developers to write better code.",

We propose to use the ZThread (http://sourceforge.net/projects/zthread/) library to explore a threading model based on an execution pool.

   "abstract": "Recently, an implementation of the Vessel Enhancing Diffusion (VED) algorithm [3] using the Insight Toolkit (ITK) framework [2] has been proposed by Enquobahrie et al.[1]. In this paper we present an alternative implementation, for two reasons. First, in this implementation all the main functionality of the algorithm, including eigensystem, vesselness, tensor calculation and PDE discretization using a forward Euler scheme are now grouped together in one single class. Although this may come at the cost of code-reusability, it improves readibility and enables application specific code optimization. The second reason is the criterion of reproducibility. Source code, test environment and example data of the paper [3] are provided.\n",

The method requires the user to provide two inputs: 1. path information in the form of start, end, and neighboring mode, the form of which path is allowed to propagate between neighboring pixels, and 2. a weighting function which sets the distance metric between neighboring pixels. A number of perspectives for choosing weighting functions are given, as well as examples using real images. This paper can also serve as an example for utilizing the Boost C++ graph library into the ITK framework.",

The \u201cradiotherapy structure set\u201d (RTSTRUCT) object of the DICOM standard is used for the transfer of patient structures and related data, between the devices found within and outside the radiotherapy department. It mainly contains the information of regions of interest (ROIs) and points of interest (E.g. dose reference points). In many cases, rather than manually drawing these ROIs on the CT images, one can indeed benefit from the automated segmentation algorithms already implemented in ITK. But at present, it is not possible to export the ROIs obtained from ITK to RTSTRUCT format. In order to bridge this gap, we have developed a framework for exporting contour data to RTSTRUCT. We provide here the complete implementation of RTSTRUCT exporter and present the details of the pipeline used. Results on a 3-D CT image of the Head and Neck (H&N) region are presented.",

   "abstract": "Our previous contributions to the ITK community include a generalized B-spline approximation scheme as well as a generalized information-theoretic measure for assessing point-set correspondence known as the Jensen-Havrda-Charvat-Tsallis (JHCT) divergence. In this submission, we combine these two contributions for the registration of labeled point-sets. The transformation model which uses the former contribution is denoted as directly manipulated free-form deformation (DMFFD) and has been used for image registration. The information-theoretic approach described not only eliminates exact cardinality constraints which plague exact landmark matching algorithms, but it also incorporates the local point-set structure into the similarity measure calculation. Although theoretical discussion of these two components is deferred to other venues, the implementation details given in this submission should be adequate for those wishing to use our algorithm. Visualization of results is aided by another of our previous contributions. Additionally, we provide the rudimentary command line parsing classes used in our testing routines which were written in the ITK style and also available to use consistent with the open-source paradigm.",

If not I suggest to have a look on the convolution filters and on the image reader.\r\n\r\nThe deformation field is updated and weighted thanks to the certainty matrix. The certainty matrix has no \\\"real interest\\\" by itself (according to the best of my knowledges). It is the respond, at a certain sampling, of the convolution of the image by the directional filters. The certainties are a linear transformation of the convoluted image.\r\n\r\nThe certainty matrix is the result of Pr. Andersson and Knutsson works from Linkoping University. I recommend the following papers\r\n- Non-rigid registration using morphons (at http://130.236.96.13/mi_old/Publications/pdfs/pettersson06.pdf#page=59 page 25 to 36)\r\n- Normalised convolution and morphons for non-rigid registration (at http://130.236.96.13/mi_old/Publications/pdfs/pkb06c.pdf )\r\n- Morphons: Paint on Priors and Elastic Canvas (http://130.236.96.13/mi_old/Publications/pdfs/ka05c.pdf)\r\nWell, also all the work of Knutsson. It mostly weights the deformation fields depending of the information on the image (a line or an edge has a higher certainty than a smooth area for example).\r\n\r\nI hope this helps.\r\n",

The basic idea is to incorporate as many cues as possible into developing a suitable \r\nlevel-set speed function so that an evolving contour exactly segments a cell/nuclei blob. We use image \r\ngradients, distance maps, multiple channel information and a shape model to drive the evolution. The \r\nframework consists of a linear pipeline of 6 new ITK \ufb01lters which are applied in succession to generate \r\nthe segmentation. The \ufb01lters extract the cell foreground, construct the speed image, \ufb01nd seed points for \r\nevolution and collect cell statistics from the segmentation. We include 2D/3D example code, parameter \r\nsettings and show the results generated on confocal images of the zebra\ufb01sh embryo.",

   "abstract": " Junctions of tubular structures (vasculature, trachea, neuron, etc) in medical images are critical for the topology of these structures. Identification of them is helpful in many applications. For example, quantification of geometric vascular features, registration of trachea movement due to respiration, tracing of neuron path. However, manual extraction of junctions can be tedious, time-consuming, and subject to operator bias. In this paper, we propose a novel method to detect them automatically and describe how to implement it in ITK framework. The input is a 2D/3D binary image that can be obtained from any segmentation techniques. The output will be positions of junctions and their sizes. There are only two parameters which need to be set by the user. We provide here the implementation as a ITK class: itk::JunctionDetectionFilter.\nPlease cite the following paper if you are interested in our work.\nG. Xiong, C. Chen, J. Chen, Y. Xie, and L.

   "abstract": "We propose a new nonlinear image registration model which is based on nonlinear elastic regularization and unbiased registration. The nonlinear elastic and the unbiased regularization terms are simplified using the change of variables by introducing an unknown that approximates the Jacobian matrix of the displacement field. This reduces the minimization to involve linear differential equations. In contrast to recently proposed unbiased fluid registration method, the new model is written in a unified variational form and is minimized using gradient descent. As a result, the new unbiased nonlinear elasticity model is computationally more efficient and easier to implement than the unbiased fluid registration. The unbiased large-deformation nonlinear elasticity method was tested using volumetric serial magnetic resonance images and shown to have some advantages for medical imaging applications.",

   "abstract": "Nonlinear finite element methods are described in which cyclic organ motion is implied from 4D scan data. The equations of motion corresponding to an explicit integration of the total Lagrangian formulation are reversed, such that the sequence of node forces which produces known changes in displacement is recovered. The forces are resolved from the global coordinate system into systems local to each element, and at every simulation time step are expressed as weighted sums of edge vectors. In the presence of large deformations and rotations, this facilitates the combination of external forces, such as tool-tissue interactions, and also positional constraints. Applications in the areas of surgery simulation and minimally invasive robotic interventions are discussed, and the methods are illustrated using CT images of a pneumatically-operated beating heart phantom.",

Clearly these displacements might not correspond to the real ones, and the recovered forces will depend on the registration method used. Therefore, the stress state inside the organ might not be represented properly and the predicted organ&rsquo;s response to external forces might not be accurate (especially for non-linear material models). The representation of the recovered nodal forces in the local coordinate system might also introduce additional errors. These aspects should be considered and a careful validation of the method must be done. No validation results are presented in the paper.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></font></p>",

Mix-resolution Br-SDM consists of two separate Br-SDM of different resolutions: a high-resolution Br-SDM which is trained with more samples to capture the detail deforming variations in the main deforming regions of interest, together with a low-resolution Br-SDM which is trained with a smaller number of samples to capture the major variations of the remaining facial points. The experiments have shown that the mix-resolution Br-SDM is able to significantly reduce the predicting error compared with the corresponding Finite Element Model, while giving a low computational cost which is characteristic of the SDM approach.",

class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\"><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\" class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\"><span>This paper describes a contact mechanics problem between the brain tissue and the surrounding skull during surgical procedures. A lot of emphasis has been put on the detecting the penetration of slave nodes defined on the brain tissue into the master body. Yet the treatment of the penetration itself is rather simple (explicit displacement boundary conditions). I wonder if this is appropriate to be called a contact problem, since it does not involve any computation on contact forces. Authors claim that the computation speed is almost independent of the mesh density for the skull surface, which seems trivial since the degrees of freedom for the master body are removed due to the fact that the skull is much stiffer than the brain tissue. Also, the algorithm requires no configuration parameters because contact forces are not computed. It seems that this method is more closely related to the approach of applying explicit boundary conditions over the entire surface of the brain, than contact mechanics approach. </span></p> <p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\" class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\"><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p style=\\\"text-align: justify\\\" class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\"><span>I think Section 3can be substantially shortened, and it would be good to have some preliminary results on actual brain and skull geometries. Also, I wonder if any numerical issues were observed for not having continuous normal vector field defined on the master surface (due to C&shy;<sub>0</sub>-continuity).</span></p> ",

But, as I read on I realised that the paper explains, in a complicated way, that displacements can be applied to nodes of the brain that appear to penetrate the skull so that they touch the surface of the skull. A simulation using an explicit scheme is then run to obtain total brain deformation. Although the search algorithm may be novel, I do not believe this to be immediately relevant to the workshop community. More relevant results would include patient validation studies and comparison of performance of the presented simulation studies with true contact-mechanics simulations. It is unclear to me how accurate this technique is and how accurate it needs to be. I would therefore argue to reject this paper. </span></p>",

The work is motivated by the desire to solve the contact problem between the soft brain and rigid skull. The description in section 3 is thorough, if somewhat verbose. I believe that this section could be shortened, without loss of completeness, with a careful rewrite. The modelling assumptions appear to be rather simplistic, especially the claim that &ldquo;contact force is not specifically of interest&rdquo;. How does this approach account for separation of the brain from the skull when/if air or fluid is allowed to enter into the cavity? Is this not an issue relevant to the brain-skull contact mechanics problem? A more considered discussion of the assumptions is required. Some discussion is also required regarding the assumptions associated with surface representations. It appears to me that the algorithm is limited to surface representation using bilinear C0 simplex elements. If so, this needs to be stated explicitly. It would be of interest to know if the approach could be generalised to other representations (e.g. higher order bases and/or smoother interelement continuity).<br /><br />The text needs to be proof-read. For example, it took several readings to understand what the following sentence in section 1 means: &ldquo;A registration method that leads to physically plausible deformation estimates is the computation of the intra-operative brain deformations using a biomechanical model, therefore treating the brain shift as a solid mechanics problem&rdquo;.<br />",

   "abstract": "Soft tissue characterization with finite element (FE) modeling is important to develop a realistic model for medical simulation, since it is possible to display complex tool-tissue interactions during medical interventions. However, it is difficult to integrate large deformation and geometrical boundary conditions to the FE computations. In this paper, the force responses and surface deformation fields of the tissues against the indentation were measured by a force transducer and three-dimensional optical system. Large indentation experiments on porcine liver were performed to estimate the radius of influence from the indented point up to 8 mm indentation and to measure the force response for 7mm indentation. The radius of influence region was plotted against various indentation depths and indenter shapes, and it could be used to determine the model size for the characterization. The tissue behavior of large deformation considering influence of the boundary conditions was characterized with FE modeling via hyperelastic and linear viscoelastic model.",

In this paper, we focus on the design of orthopaedic implants that fit a maximum percentage of the target population, both in terms of geometry and biomechanical stability. CT scans of the bone under consideration are registered non-rigidly to obtain correspondences in position between them. A statistical model of shape is computed by means of principal component analysis. A method to automatically propagate standardize fractures on the statistically-based bone population has been developed as well as tools to optimize implant position to best-fit the bone surface. Afterwards, finite element analysis is performed to analyse the biomechanical performance of the bone/implant construct. The mechanical behaviour of different PCA bone instances is compared for tibia representing the Asian and Caucasian populations.",

The Authors build statistical<br />shape model of a tibia and use to optimise the implant position. They also conduct<br />modelling analysis (FE method is used) biomechanical performance of bone-implant<br />construct. The methodology appears to be original and technically sound. However, some<br />aspects (bone-to-bone and bone-to-implant interactions) of the modelling conduct require<br />further clarification. Therefore, my opinion is that before the paper can be regarded as<br />ready for publication/presentation in the Workshop, the Authors should answer the<br />questions given below and modify the paper following them.</p><p><br /><strong>Major comments</strong><br />1) Biomechanical FE Simulations: How were the interactions between two split (as a<br />result of fracture) bone parts and between the bones and implant modelled?<br />The Authors write that &ldquo;3D beam elements were used to fix implant to the bone&rdquo;<br />and that &ldquo;Attachment of the beam to the bone was preformed using an embedded<br />element technique&rdquo;. However, in order for such modelling of attachment to be<br />meaningful, the implant should be allowed to move/slide in relation to the bone. This<br />would require application of contact interface (or similar type of constrain) between<br />the implant and bone, and between two split bone parts. The paper does not mention<br />existence of any type of such interface between the bone and implant and between<br />two split bone parts.</p><p><br />2) What finite element solver was used and what type of finite element analysis (i.e.<br />geometrically linear or non-linear) was applied?</p><p><br />3) Legend of Table 1 (p. 8): Was the bone-implant distance determined using imagebased<br />methods described in Sections 2-4?</p><p><br /><strong>Minor comments</strong><br />1) P. 2 reference [Rueckert] is missing in the Reference list</p><p><br />2) P. 2, figure 1 caption.

   "abstract": "Primary stability of osseointegrated implants is necessary for short and long-term success of the treatment. This paper presents a method to help clinicians preoperatively assess this primary implant stability. The method combines a planning software with a in-house finite element solver. Once the clinician has chosen a position for the implant on the planning tool, a finite element analysis is automatically started and calculates the mechanical stability of the implant at this position. The process is designed to be as simple and fast as possible for an efficient clinical use. Mechanical testing material was used to validate the stability measured by the software. The novel tool presented here leads the way to a new generation of intelligent computer-assisted tools able to give a priori indication on the life span of the implant.",

     "content": "<p><em>(This review can be also viewed by opening the attached PDF file)</em><br /> </p><p>The idea of pre-operative prediction of mechanical properties of dental implant using<br />finite element method presented in the paper is very exciting. However, the<br />implementation of this idea appears to be flawed, which includes the following:</p><p><br />1) Justification for building &ldquo;a patient-specific&rdquo; model using a generic mesh and<br />patient-specific bone material properties is not given.</p><p><br />2) Selection of boundary conditions for the implant (the implant is rigidly fixed<br />to the bone) lacks justification.</p><p><br />3) Verification of in-house finite element code developed in the study is<br />incomplete.</p><p><br />4) The finite element modelling results grossly differ from the experimental data<br />obtained using artificial bone.</p><p><br />Therefore, I cannot recommend this manuscript for publication in its current form. A<br />major revision of the entire study should be undertaken.</p><p><br /><strong>Major comments</strong><br />1) It is commonly accepted practice that newly developed numerical algorithms<br />(such as e.g. in-house finite element codes) are at first verified against the<br />existing well-established numerical procedures (such as e.g. those<br />implemented in commercial finite element codes) or against simple examples<br />for which solutions are known (e.g. Viceconti et al. 2005, Zienkiewicz 2000).<br />The Authors should include such verification of their code in the paper.</p><p><br />2) Finite element method is a numerical method for solving partial differential<br />equations. Therefore, determining correlation coefficients between the<br />experimental and finite element modelling results when validating finite<br />element models as done in Results section is misleading. Close to linear<br />relationship between the modelling and experimental results is not sufficient<br />to claim that the modelling results are &ldquo;promising &hellip; in terms of accuracy &hellip;&rdquo;<br />as stated by the Authors in Discussion. The results shown in Figure 5 indicate<br />that the experimentally determined removal torque is around five times greater<br />than the one predicted using the finite element model. This is a clear<br />indication of gross disagreement between the modelling and experimental<br />results and evidence of serious flaw in either modelling or experimental (or<br />both) part of the study. Differences of 500% between the modelling and<br />experimental are unacceptable by any engineering standard given the fact the<br />constitutive properties of the modelled continuum are well-known. These<br />differences call for major revision of the entire study.</p><p><br />3) Figure 6 clearly indicates that the relationship between the modelling and<br />experimental results is non-linear. Justification for drawing a straight line<br />trough the points clearly following non-linear pattern should be given. As was<br />with Figure 5, 200% difference between the experimental and modelling<br />results should be explained, and relevant revision of the study should be<br />undertaken to eliminate any difference of such large magnitude.</p><p><br />4) P. 3: &ldquo;The removal torque is approximated by multiplying the friction<br />coefficient by the total of the radial reaction forces due to pressfit at the<br />bone/implant interface&rdquo;. Given the fact that no contact between the bone and<br />implant was modelled, how was the radial reaction force calculated?</p><p><br />5) Quality of the results obtained using a finite element model is determined not<br />only by accuracy of the constitutive parameters for the model but also by how<br />closely the model represents the geometry and boundary conditions of the<br />analysed structure (see e.g. Bathe 1996). What was the rationale for the<br />Authors&rsquo; assumption that patient-specific constitutive properties and generic<br />implant and bone geometry are sufficient to build a patient-specific boneimplant<br />model?</p><p><br />6) How were the dimensions of the bone part of the model determined?</p><p><br />7) In the first paragraph of section 2.1.2 Construction of patient-specific finite<br />element analysis the Authors state that &ldquo;The mesh used for the simulation is a<br />generic mesh &hellip;&rdquo;.

   "abstract": "Meaningful physical models are important for studying cardiac physiology, such as quantitative assessments of pathology via changes in model parameters, and recovering information from medical images. In order to achieve realistic deformation studies, an anatomically accurate cardiac model under the prolate spheroidal coordinate system has been proposed, which comprises the pole-zero constitutive law characterized by 18 material parameters. Nevertheless, the large number of parameters and the complicated mathematics under the curvilinear coordinate system make it difficult to implement and computationally expensive. In consequence, we propose a cardiac model under the cartesian coordinate system comprising the Costa law, which is tailored for medical image analysis. The Costa law is characterized by a strain energy function with only seven material parameters, but has been reported as the best among the five tested well-known models in a comparative study, including the pole-zero law. In our framework, the penalty method for material incompressibility is used to avoid introduction of extra variables. Furthermore, we introduce a simple but novel boundary condition for enforcing cardiac specific boundary displacements under the cartesian coordinate system. With the active stresses provided by cardiac electromechanical models, and also the blood pressures acting as the natural boundary conditions on the endocardial surfaces, the physiologically plausible active deformation of the heart can be simulated. Experiments have been done on a cubical object to verify the correctness of the implementation, and also on a canine heart architecture to show the physiological plausibility of the cardiac model.",

Journal of Elasticity 61:143&ndash;164, 2000; which also uses the penalty method for incompressibility). <span> </span>Throughout the manuscript, the authors repeatedly highlight some issues regarding one previous study (ref [9]), such as the choice of constitutive relation (&ldquo;pole-zero law&rdquo;) and coordinate system (&ldquo;prolate spheroidal coordinates&rdquo;). Instead, they would do better to concentrate on the/novel aspects of their own work &ndash; noting that models using Cartesian coordinates (e.g. Vetter et al., Annals of Biomedical Engineering, 28:781&ndash;792, 2000), and orthotropic material relations (e.g. Usyk et al., as above) have been widely studied. </span></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>The authors also claim that their representation of the constraint that the pericardial sac places on wall motion is novel. However, the use of this choice of boundary conditions is remains to be quantitatively validated against experimental recordings or medical images (more on this below).

A deformation study involving simple shear is presented. Analytical homogenous data are compared against numerical (finite element) non-homogeneous model predictions (Fig 1a shows non-homogeneous deformation). Thus two different types of deformation are being compared. Also of concern is: &ldquo;yet the errors increase when the deformation becomes large&rdquo; (parag. below Eq.14) &ndash; this requires further investigation (e.g. did errors reduce with smaller step size?). Furthermore, this test is based on just one mode of deformation, which involves just 2 of the 6 independent components of the strain tensor. A full validation should include multiple modes of deformation involving the shear and normal components of strain. Perhaps a more appropriate and comprehensive closed-form solution is that of the pressure inflation, axial extension and torsion of a homogeneous, isotropic cylinder (eg. Rivlin 1950, Phil. Trans.

Such gross observations have been previously reproduced using axi-symmetric truncated ellipsoids (e.g. the Dutch groups of Arts, Bovendeerd, et al.).

   "abstract": "The assignment of bone material properties to finite element model is a fundamental step in finite element analysis and has great influence on analysis results. Most work done in this area has adopted isotropic assignment strategy as its simplicity. However, bone material is widely recognized as being anisotropic rather than isotropic. Therefore, this work is aimed to simulate the inhomogeneity and anisotropy of femur by assigning each element of the mesh model the material properties with a numerical integration method and properly defining the principal material orientation, and then compare the biomechanical analysis results of isotropic model with that of anisotropic model under six different loading conditions. Based on the analysis results of the equivalent Von Mises stress and the nodal displacement, four different regions of interest are chosen to achieve this comparison. The results show that significant differences between the two material property assignments exist in the regions where anisotropic material property is sensitive to orientation definition. Thus, orientation definition is important to finite element simulation of bone material properties.",

     "content": "<p><em>(This review can be also viewed by opening the attached PDF file)</em></p><p><br />The paper addresses an important problem of the bone tissue anisotropy in finite element<br />modelling of long bones (femur is used) and, as such, fits well within the scope of the<br />Workshop. However, description of the modelling methods used is insufficient to fully<br />evaluate whether the study is technically sound. Therefore, my opinion is that the paper<br />can be accepted for publication in the Workshop only if the Authors answer the<br />questions/comments given below and modify their manuscript following them.</p><p><br /><strong>Major comments</strong><br />1) What were the boundary conditions for the finite element model used? Figure 2<br />shows the force applied to the femoral head, but no information is given how the<br />bone was supported. Was the force applied to a single node or distributed over a set<br />of nodes?</p><p><br />2) On p. 3 the Authors write that linear hexahedral element were used. Were they fullyintegrated<br />or under-integrated hexahedrals?</p><p><br />3) What finite element solver was used and what type of finite element analysis (i.e.<br />geometrically linear or non-linear) was applied?</p><p><br />4) P. 6 Eqs. (7) and (8): How the parameters &Delta;u and &Delta;&sigma; in a given region of interest<br />were calculated? Were they averaged over the elements and nodes in a given region<br />or they were calculated for the selected nodes and elements?</p><p><br />5) In the last paragraph of Discussion the Authors state that the models developed so far<br />&ldquo;cannot reproduce exactly in vivo conditions&rdquo; and suggest that their method has<br />features that ensure such &ldquo;reproducibility&rdquo;. Can the Authors explain what do they<br />mean by &ldquo;in vivo conditions&rdquo; and how they can be sure that their method can<br />represent them given the fact that the study contains no validation of the modelling<br />results.</p><p><br />6) Figure 3: The regions of interests are not indicated.</p><p><br />7) Figure 4: What material properties are shown in this figure and what are their units?</p><p><br />8) Eqs. (1)-(6): Were Eqs. (1)-(6) derived by the Authors or were they obtained from<br />the literature. If they were obtained from the literature, the references should be<br />given.</p><p><br /><strong>Minor comments:</strong><br />1) The title &ldquo;Orientation definition of anisotropy is important to finite element<br />simulation of bone material properties&rdquo; does not correspond well to the scope and<br />content of the study. The study indicates that there are important differences between<br />the Von Mises stress and nodal displacements determined using isotropic and<br />orthotropic material models in regions where the principal material orientations vary.<br />The &ldquo;finite element simulation of bone material properties&rdquo; as such is not addressed<br />despite reference to such simulation in the title. Therefore, the Authors should<br />modify the title so it signals the study scope and results to the readers in a<br />meaningful way.</p><p><br />2) First sentence of Introduction: What do the Authors mean by stating that Finite<br />element (FE) analysis is &ldquo;non-invasive method&rdquo;. Finite element analysis is a<br />numerical method for solving partial differential equations and it does make much<br />sense to refer to it as either &ldquo;invasive&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-invasive&rdquo;.</p><p><br />3) Does MP refer to MPa (mega Pascals) and GP to GPa (giga Pascals)?</p><p><br />4) What are the units for density and Young&rsquo;s modulus in Eqs. (3) and (4). </p>",

   "abstract": "We present a framework for cardiac motion recovery using the adjustment of an electromechanical model of the heart to cine Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI). This approach is based on a constrained minimisation of an energy coupling the model and the data. Our method can be seen as a data assimilation of a dynamic system that allows us to weight appropriately the confidence in the model and the confidence in the data. After a short overview of the electromechanical model of the ventricles, we describe the processing of cine MR images and the methodology for motion recovery. Then, we compare this method to the methodology used in data assimilation. Presented results on motion recovery from given cine-MRI are very promising. In particular, we show that our coupling approach allows us to recover some tangential component of the ventricles motion which cannot be obtained from classical geometrical tracking approaches due to the aperture problem.",

The main issue that I concern is difference between this paper and<br />Dr. Pengcheng Shi previuos work.<br />Authors claims that their data assimilation, which actually is the state space motion estimation, is inspired<br />by reference [7]. But Dr. Pengcheng Shi&#39;s group have published a series of papers of the state space motion<br />estimation framework:<br />Stochastic finite element framework for simultaneous estimation of cardiac kinematic functions and<br />material parameters in Medical Image Analysis 2003.<br />Huafeng Liu, Pengcheng Shi: Simultaneous Estimation of Left Ventricular Motion and Material Properties<br />with Maximum a Posteriori Strategy. CVPR 2003.<br />Ken C.L. Wong, Pengcheng Shi: Finite Deformation Guided Nonlinear Filtering for Multiframe Cardiac<br />Motion Analysis. MICCAI 2004<br />Authors of reference [7] may not know medical image community so well, but author of this paper should<br />realize the simality of reference [7] and Dr. Pengcheng Shi&#39;s work. It is hard not to ask the simality between<br />reference [7] and [12]. Obviously I can see Dr. Pengcheng Shi has introduced the state space into medical<br />image community first. It is not hard to see that data assimilation in this paper is very similar to Dr.<br />Pengcheng Shi&#39;s the state space motion estimation framework, but authors only mention one of their works.<br />So authors should clearify their originality in this paper with a comparison of this work and Dr. Pengcheng<br />Shi&#39;s works, otherwise I recommend a direct reject. Furthermore, in the part of data assimilation, authors<br />failed to quantitively describe their data assimilation method, such as what is the noise rate.<br />The conclusion in reference in [17] is correct, but authors should notice that their groups have developed<br />several efforts to decrease the size of covariance matrices.<br />More details should be added. Such as equation (1). what is the value of APD, sigma_c and sigma_0.<br />What is HP? How to determine Td and Tr from authors&#39; electrical simulation? Though authors describe<br />what is Td and Tr qualitively, readers still can not determine Td and Tr quantitively. These inefficiencies<br />dmage the quality of paper a lot. Authors should definitely revise them.",

     "content": "<p class=\"\\&quot;MsoNormal\\&quot;\">This manuscript proposes a method for the analysis of heart wall motion using an electromechanical model. The goal is to recover the motion of the heart, including the recovery of through-plane motion and rotational motion, which are poorly constrained by the image data, due to the aperture problem. A deformable model framework is presented which uses the model as an &ldquo;internal energy&rdquo; providing physiologically realistic motions constrained by the given data. This framework is shown to be equivalent to a data assimilation approach derived from system identification theory (reference 7). This is an interesting paper, well written on the whole, and clearly presented. </p><p class=\"\\&quot;MsoNormal\\&quot;\">General comments:</p><ol>The application of state estimation methods to cardiac motion recovery is not new and the authors should reveiw the work by Shi et al. <li class=\"\\&quot;MsoNormal\\&quot;\">The application is limited to motion recovery. Another application could be the recovery of biophysical information such as the model parameters, but this is not explored here. Model parameters are fixed and not optimized to the motion (unlike reference 7 in which physiological parameters of the model itself are also estimated). Rather, the method utilizes a model in a similar way to previous methods which incorporate <em>a priori</em> knowledge as a smoothing term (model energy) in the objective function. If so, the motivation for a physiological electromechanical energy term should be made clearer in the Introduction, as opposed to simpler terms used in the past. It should also be made clearer in the Methods that the model parameters are not optimized. </li><li class=\"\\&quot;MsoNormal\\&quot;\">In the absence of data, the model will deform in a manner totally prescribed by the model energy. With data, there is a tradeoff between the model energy and the data term leading to a solution outside the space of physiological solutions. It should be made clear in the Discussion that this formulation is not physiological, for example boundary forces are not applied in this fashion in the real heart.</li><li class=\"\\&quot;MsoNormal\\&quot;\">It should be noted in the conclusions that the assumptions of the model are not realistic, given that we know the heart is a nonlinear material undergoing large strains. This does not detract from the clinical utility of the method, so long as the simplistic nature of the assumptions are noted.</li></ol><span><font face=\"\\&quot;Times\" size=\"\\&quot;2\\&quot;\">&nbsp;</font></span> <p class=\"\\&quot;MsoNormal\\&quot;\">Specific Comments:</p><span><font face=\"\\&quot;Times\" size=\"\\&quot;2\\&quot;\">&nbsp;</font></span> <ol>The explanation of the acquisition and problems with the real data (RV segmentation etc) should occur in the Methods section (around 3.2), rather than in the Results section 5.2. This would explain the RV-LV volume mismatch near Fig 3, where it is demonstrated. Give details of what images were acquired, pulse sequence parameters etc. <li class=\"\\&quot;MsoNormal\\&quot;\">There are a few mistakes in the English: eg. in the Introduction &ldquo;the heart electromechanical activity&rdquo; should be &ldquo;the heart&rsquo;s electromechanical activity&rdquo;, &ldquo;has received a growing attention&rdquo; should be &ldquo;has received growing attention&rdquo;, &ldquo;personalised electromechanical model of the heart&rdquo; should be &ldquo;personalised electromechanical models of the heart&rdquo;, &ldquo;In such framework&rdquo; should be &ldquo;In such a framework&rdquo;, &ldquo;mesh is fit on the&rdquo; should be &ldquo;mesh is fit to the&rdquo;, &ldquo;assimilation techniques consisting in adjusting&rdquo; should be &ldquo;assimilation techniques consisting of adjusting&rdquo;, &ldquo;since they involves full covariance&rdquo; should be &ldquo;since they involve full covariance&rdquo;.</li><li class=\"\\&quot;MsoNormal\\&quot;\">Section 3.2: What passive material parameters are taken from what literature?</li></ol><span><font face=\"\\&quot;Times\" size=\"\\&quot;2\\&quot;\">&nbsp;</font></span><span><font face=\"\\&quot;Times\" size=\"\\&quot;2\\&quot;\">&nbsp;</font></span><span><font face=\"\\&quot;Times\" size=\"\\&quot;2\\&quot;\">&nbsp;</font></span> <p>&nbsp;</p>",

   "abstract": "Surgical repair of the mitral valve results in better\r\noutcomes than valve replacement, yet diseased valves\r\nare often replaced due to the technical difficulty of the\r\nrepair process. A surgical planning system based on\r\npatient-specific medical images that allows surgeons to\r\nsimulate and compare potential repair strategies could\r\ngreatly improve surgical outcomes. The system must\r\nsimulate valve closure quickly and handle the complex\r\nboundary conditions imposed by the chords that tether\r\nthe valve leaflets. We have developed a process for\r\ngenerating a triangulated mesh of the valve surface\r\nfrom volumetric image data of the opened valve. The\r\nclosed position of the mesh is then computed using a\r\nmass-spring model of dynamics. In the mass-spring\r\nmodel, triangle sides are treated as linear springs\r\nsupporting only tension. Chords are also treated as\r\nlinear springs, and self-collisions are detected and\r\nhandled inelastically. The equations of motion are\r\nsolved using implicit numerical integration. The\r\nsimulated closed state is compared with an image of the\r\nsame valve taken in the closed state to assess accuracy\r\nof the model. The model exhibits rapid valve closure\r\nand is able to predict the closed state of the valve with\r\nreasonable accuracy.",

   "abstract": "The elastic registration of medical scans from different acquisition sequences is becoming an important topic for many research labs that would like to continue the post-processing of medical scans acquired via the new generation of high-field-strength scanners. In this note, we present a parameter-free registration algorithm that is well suited for this scenario as it requires no tuning to specific acquisition sequences. The algorithm encompasses a new numerical scheme for computing elastic registration maps based on the minimizing flow approach to optimal mass transport. The approach utilizes all of the gray-scale data in both images, and the optimal mapping from image A to image B is the inverse of the optimal mapping from B to A. Further, no landmarks need to be specified, and the minimizer of the distance functional involved is unique. We apply the algorithm to register the white matter folds of two different scans and use the results to parcellate the cortex of the target image. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the optimal mass transport function has been applied to register large 3D multimodal data sets.",

It also requires that the intensities of the two input images (atlas and MRI) be normalized and rescaled to make sure that both have the same mass (intensity). This will certainly influence the results especially if the intensity distribution differs considerably between the atlas and the MRI scan (scanning sequences or sensors are very different).</font></p><p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt\" class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">&nbsp;&nbsp; The authors present the difference in white matter intensity between the patient MRI and the re-sampled atlas image as a proof of accuracy.

   "abstract": "Very little is known about the deformation effects of tumour growth within the brain. Computer simulations have the potential to\r\ncalculate such deformations. A method for computing localised high deformations within the brain's soft tissue is presented. Such\r\nknowledge would be significant towards neuroscience and neurosurgery, particularly for quantifying tumour aggressiveness,\r\ntherapy planning, as well as surgical planning and simulation. A Finite Element mesh used in the vicinity of a growing tumour is\r\nvery quickly destroyed and cannot be used reliably unless complicated automatic re-meshing exists. Mesh-free methods are\r\ncapable of handling much larger deformations, however are known to be less reliable that Finite Element analysis for moderate\r\ndeformations. A mixed-mesh approach utilises mesh-free regions within localised high-deformation zones, with the remaining\r\nmodel comprised of a Finite Element mesh. In this study, a new algorithm is proposed coupling the Finite Element and Element\r\nFree Galerkin methods for use in applications of high localised deformation, such as brain tumour growth. The algorithm is\r\nverified against a number of separate Finite Element and mesh-free problems solved via validated/commercial software.\r\nMaximum errors of less than 0.85 mm were maintained, corresponding to the working resolution of an MRI scan. A mixed-mesh\r\nbrain model is analysed with respect to different tumour growth volumes located behind the left ventricle. Significant\r\ndisplacements of up to 9.66 mm surrounding a 4118 mm3 sized tumour are noted, with 14.5% of the brain mesh suffering\r\ndeformation greater than 5 mm.",

In this<br />paper, authors adopted this method into new biological application, brain tumor, and shown with nice<br />numerical validation. I can follow mathematical parts of EFG, but authors may need to add more details<br />into section 3.2, Analysis Solver. Because the format of Total Largrange equation is not easy to be<br />understood.<br />Since meshfree method is the key selling point of this paper, authors should discuss more details of EFG<br />implementation. EFG has been proved with enough stability and consisitency in mechanical application in<br />many papers. Penalty method has been proposed to handle essenstial conditions very well. But authors<br />claim that a solely mesh-free Element Free Galerkin (EFG) model will prove to be inefficient, suffering<br />from consistency and stability issues, as well as Dirichlet boundary difficulties (page 1). If it is in this<br />particular application, brain tumor, authors should use numerical experiments to support their claims. If it<br />has been proved in other papers, authors should add more details and put enough references over there.<br />Authors also claims that FEM on its own will be inaccurate and problematic for modelling the brain<br />deformation response to tumour growth, since the mesh surrounding the tumour is easily distorted,<br />consequently destroying elements. Yes, it is true. but authors should also metion that remesh in this<br />situatuon is very time-consuming even though FEM can handle large deformation after remehsing.<br />Section 3.1.2 Mixed-Mesh Reader, and Figure 3.1: Block diagram of the preprocessing phase (red) and<br />analysis solver (green) may not be able to help understand FEM and EFG so much. It is a little bit far away<br />from coupling of FEM and EFG. The details of implementation, such as how to do integeration for EFG,<br />how to chose the density of nodes in EFG and how to handle the interface of FEM and EFG may help a lot.<br />",

   "abstract": "A large number of pathological conditions result in significant changes of the mechanical properties of the aortic wall. Using the Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) as an indicator of aortic stiffness has been proposed for several decades. Pulse Wave Imaging (PWI) is an ultrasonography-based imaging method that has been developed to map and quantify the pulse wave (PW) propagation along the abdominal aortic wall and measure its local properties. We present a finite-element-based approach that aims at improving our understanding of the complex PW patterns observed by PWI and their relationship to the underlying mechanical properties. A Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) coupled model was developed based on an idealized axisymmetric aorta geometry. The accuracy of the model as well as its ability to reproduce realistic PW propagation were evaluated by performing a parametric analysis on aortic elasticity, by varying the aortic Young\ufffds modulus between 20 kPa and 2000 kPa. The Finite-Element model was able to predict with good accuracy the expected PWV values in different theoretical cases, with an averaged relative difference of 14% in the 20kPa-100kPa, which corresponds to a wide physiologic range for stiffness of the healthy aorta. This study allows to validate the proposed FE model as a tool that is capable of representing quantitatively the pulse wave patterns in the aorta.",

   "abstract": "This coronary-artery extraction method uses one initialization point per vessel. First, a mask is computed by use of a region-growing algorithm, which starts from the initial point and stops when no more connected voxels fall within an interactively defined intensity range. The centerline tracking is then\nperformed within the mask, starting from the same initial point. This algorithm is based on a prediction/estimation scheme. It uses the first- and second-order image moments calculated within a spherical volume that slides along the vessel, and the radius of which is automatically adjusted to the local radius\nof the vessel. The evolution of the radius of the sphere is based on the analysis of the eigenvalues of the inertia matrix in a multi-scale framework. The estimation of the current point location makes use\nof an elastic model similar to \u201dsnakes\u201d. The point iteratively moves under the action of an image-force attracting it to the local gravity center, and under the reaction of the internal forces of the model, which\nreflect its shape constraints: continuity and smoothness. The prediction makes use of the eigenvectors of\nthe inertia matrix. The stopping criteria of the centerline tracking are based on the size of the sphere and on the percentage of the masked voxels within the sphere.\nOn 8 training CT datasets, the following mean results were obtained. Overlap with reference: considering the whole length (OV) 80.1%, until the first failure (OF) 48.9%, in clinically relevant segments (radius > 1.5 mm, OT) 81.7%. Average distance from reference: considering the whole length\n(AD) 4.32 mm, limited to segments where the semiautomatic centerline remains within the vessel (AI) 0.39 mm, in clinically relevant segments (AT) 4.13 mm. On 16 testing datasets, these results were respectively: OV =80.2%, OF =39.3%, OT =82.1%, AD =5.05 mm, AI =0.41 mm and AT =4.58 mm. \nA number of failures was due to the the fact that the model does not handle the bifurcations.",

   "abstract": "The extraction of the coronary artery central lumen lines from CTA datasets is a necessary prerequisite for the computerized assessment of heart related disease. In this work, we present an automatic approach for this task that consists of generic methods for detection of tubular objects, extraction of their centerlines, grouping of the single centerlines into complete tree structures, and some application specific adaptions for the identification of the coronary arteries. The tube detection approach is based on the Gradient Vector Flow and an analysis of the resulting vector field. Contrary to conventional tube detection filters this approach avoids multi-scale analysis with related scale space problems and is able to identify tubular objects surrounded by different tissues such as blood vessels in proximity of calcifications. After identification of the tubular structures their centerlines are extracted and grouped into complete tree structures. Based on gray value information and centerline length tubular structures not belonging to the coronary arteries are removed. The approach has been evaluated on 16 clinical datasets showing a high overlap of 94% with known reference centerlines and an average distance of 0.58mm.",

   "abstract": "We present a new method for the simultaneous, nearly automatic segmentation of liver contours, vessels,\r\nand tumors from abdominal CTA scans. The method repeatedly applies multi-resolution, multi-class\r\nsmoothed Bayesian classification followed by morphological adjustment and active contours refinement.\r\nIt uses multi-class and voxel neighborhood information to compute an accurate intensity distribution\r\nfunction for each class. Only one user-defined voxel seed for the liver and additional seeds according\r\nto the number of tumors inside the liver are required for initialization. The algorithm do not require\r\nmanual adjustment of internal parameters. In this work, a retrospective study on a validated clinical\r\ndataset totaling 20 tumors from 9 patients CTAs\ufffd was performed. An aggregated competition score of\r\n61 was obtained on the test set of this database. In addition we measured the robustness of our algorithm\r\nto different seeds initializations. These results suggest that our method is clinically applicable, accurate,\r\nefficient, and robust to seed selection compared to manually generated ground truth segmentation and to\r\nother semi-automatic segmentation methods.",

Intuitively,\r\nthe core points are centers of intensity plateaus in two-dimensional slices through the input image. The\r\nstarting and the end point of the desired vessel (S and E) are also considered core points. The weighted\r\ncore graph is built by connecting nearby core points with edges. Edge weights are designed so that edges\r\nof large weights are unlikely to follow a vessel segment. We compute the shortest path connecting S and\r\nE in the core graph. The output is the result of applying shortcutting operations to this path.",

   "abstract": "Automatic tracking of coronary arteries in Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) is a challenging task. To accomplish it we propose a method consisting of two main steps: (1) A 3D model of the heart is matched for detecting the approximate position of the heart. Based on this information candidates for origins of coronary arteries are calculated. (2) Fitting of cylindrical sampling patterns is performed for extracting the vessel tree of coronary arteries. Branching and termination are handled by depth-first search and noise level estimation respectively. Results show that -- compared to human intra-observer variations -- the presented method performs worse for accuracy measures (on average 39.4 scores), but slightly better for overlap measures (on average 51.5 scores).",

   "abstract": "Liver tumour segmentation from computed tomography (CT) scans is a challenging task. A semi-automatic method based on 2D region growing with knowledge-based constraints is proposed to segment lesions from constituent 2D slices obtained from 3D CT images. Minimal user involvement is required to define an approximate region of interest around the suspected legion area. The seed point and feature vectors are then calculated and voxels are labeled using a region-growing approach. Knowledge-based constraints are incorporated into the method to ensure the size and shape of the segmented region is within acceptable parameters. The individual segmented lesions can then be stacked together to generate a 3D volume. The proposed method was tested on a training set of 10 tumours and a testing set of 10 tumours. To evaluate the results quantitatively, various measures were used to generate scores. Based on the results obtained from the 10 testing tumours, the method was resulted in an average score of 64.",

Then the extracted tumor contour, after some morphological operations, was projected to its neighboring slices for automated sampling, learning and further voxel classification in neighboring slices. This propagation procedure continued till all tumor-containing slices were processed. The method was tested using 3D CT images with 10 liver tumors and a set of quantitative measures were computed, resulted in an averaged overall performance score of 72.",

   "abstract": "Automatic segmentation of liver tumorous regions often fails due to high noise and large variance of tumors. In this work, a semi-automatic algorithm is proposed to segment liver tumors from computed tomography (CT) images. To cope with the variance of tumors, their intensity probability density functions (PDF) are modeled as a bag of Gaussians unlike the previous works where the tumor is modeled as a single Gaussian, and employ a three-dimensional seeded region growing (SRG) method. The bag of Gaussians are initialized at manually selected seeds and updated during growing process iteratively. There are two criteria to be ful&#64257;lled for growing: one is the Bayesian decision rule, and the other is a model matching measure. Once the growing is terminated, morphological operations are performed to re&#64257;ne the result. This method, showing promising performance, has been evaluated using ten CT scans of livers with twenty tumors provided by the organizer of the 3D Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge 2008.",

This paper presents a semi-automatic algorithm (one input point per vessel) based on morphological grayscale local reconstructions in 3D images devoted to the extraction of the coronary artery tree. The algorithm has been evaluated in the framework of the Coronary Artery Tracking Challenge 2008 [1], obtaining consistent results in overlapping measurements (a mean of 70% of the vessel well tracked). Poor results in accuracy measurements suggest that future work should refine the centerline extraction. The algorithm can be efficiently implemented and its general strategy can be easily extrapolated to a completely automated centerline extraction or to a user interactive vessel extraction.",

   "abstract": "In CT images, tumors located in a liver are generally identified by intensity difference between tumor and liver. The intensity of the tumor can be lower and or higher than that of the liver. However, the main problem of liver tumor detection from is related to low contrast between tumor and liver intensities. Tumor sometimes presents in a very small dimension and makes the detection even more difficult. In this work, we focus on contrast enhancement of CT images containing liver and tumor based on the histogram processing as a necessary preprocessing for liver tumor identification. Results show that using our proposed method, the contrast of the CT images can be enhanced and results in relatively accurate identification of tumors in the liver.",

The rough segmentation is\r\nused to estimate the range of intensity values in the tumor,\r\nwhich is used to obtain a more accurate segmentation by a\r\nmethod originally developed for pulmonary nodules. The result\r\nof the second segmentation is interpolated at the resolution of\r\nthe original data.\r\n\r\nThe development of the system is a part of the 2008 3D\r\nSegmentation in the Clinic: A Grand Challenge competition.

The\r\noriginality of the work consists in applying these models to the\r\nregion adjacency graph of a watershed transform. We detail the\r\nassumptions and the approximations introduced in these models by\r\nusing a region graph instead of a pixel graph. This strategy leads\r\nto an interactive method that we use to delineate tumors in 3D CT\r\nimages. We detail our strategy to achieve relevant segmentations of\r\nthese structures and compare our results to hand made segmentations\r\ndone by experienced radiologists.

   "abstract": "A method for automatic liver tumor segmentation from computer tomography (CT) images is presented in this paper. Segmentation is an important operation before surgery planning, and automatic methods offer an alternative to laborious manual segmentation. In addition, segmentations of automatic methods are reproducible, so they can be reliably evaluated and they do not depend on the performer of the segmentation. In this work, the segmentation is performed in two stages. First a rough segmentation of tumors is obtained by simple thresholding and morphological operations. \r\nThe second stage refines the rough segmentation result using fuzzy clustering and a geometric deformable model (GDM) that is fitted on the clustering result. \r\nThe method was evaluated with data provided by Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge 08, to which the method also participated. The data included 10 \r\nimages from which 20 tumors were segmented. The method showed promising results.",

Twenty datasets from MS patients with FLAIR, T1,T2, MD and FA data with expert annotations are available as training set from the MICCAI 2008 challenge on MS, and 24 test datasets. Our local feature vector method contains neighbourhood voxel intensities, histogram and MS probability atlas information. Principal Component Analysis(PCA) \\cite{PCA} with log-likelihood ratio is used to classify each voxel. MRI suffers from intensity inhomogenities. We try to correct this ''bias field'' with 3 methods: a genetic algorithm, edge preserving filtering and atlas based correction. A large observer variability exist between expert classifications, but the similarity scores between model and expert classifications are often lower. Our model gives the best classification results with raw data, because bias correction gives artifacts at the edges and flatten large MS lesions.",

   "abstract": "This paper proposes a new method for fully automated multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation in cranial magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The algorithm uses the T1-weighted and the fluid attenuation inversion recovery scans. It is based the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classification technique. The data has been acquired at the Children\ufffds Hospital Boston (CHB) and the University of North Carolina (UNC). Manual segmentations, composed by a human expert of the CHB, were used for training of the KNN-classification. The method uses voxel location and signal intensity information for determination of the probability being a lesion per voxel, thus generating probabilistic segmentation images. By applying a threshold on the probabilistic images binary segmentations are derived. Automatic segmentations were performed on a set of testing images, and compared with manual segmentations from a CHB and a UNC expert rater. Furthermore, a combined segmentation was composed from segmentations from different algorithms, and used for evaluation. The proposed method shows good resemblance with the segmentations of the CHB rater. High specificity and lower specificity has been observed in comparison with the combined segmentations. Over- and undersegmentation can be easily corrected in this procedure by varying the threshold on the probabilistic segmentation image. The proposed method offers an automated and fully reproducible approach that accurate and applicable on standard clinical MR images.",

Also, I think that the issue of inter-rater variability is not really related to data quality here, as inter-rater variability is an inherent fact of MS lesion segmentation. This inter-rater variability is one of the main reasons towards automated methods. Furthermore, the methods are evaluated with respect to this inter-rater variability, i.e. if a method varies from one rater as much as another rater then it would get a score of 90.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>Also, it seems that the authors were unaware of the updated training datasets that were available several weeks before the submission due date. The updated training datasets had a full set of segmentation from the CHB rater for all datasets.

For this aim, we use the Trimmed Likelihood Estimator (TLE) to extract outliers. Furthermore, neighborhood information is included using the HMC model and we propose to incorporate a priori information brought by a probabilistic atlas.",

   "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis diagnosis and patient follow-up can be helped by an evaluation of the lesion load in MRI sequences. A lot of automatic methods to segment these lesions are available in the literature. The MICCAI workshop Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation Challenge 08 allows to test and compare these algorithms. This paper presents a method designed to detect hyperintense signal area on T2-FLAIR sequence and its results on the Challenge test data. The proposed algorithm uses only three conventional MRI sequences: T1, T2 and T2-FLAIR. First, images are cropped, spatially unbiased and skull-stripped. A segmentation of the brain into its different compartments is performed on the T1 and the T2 sequences. From these segmentations, a threshold for the T2-FLAIR sequence is automatically computed. Then postprocessing operations select the most plausible lesions in the obtained hyperintense signals. Global result on the test data (80/100) is close to the inter-expert variability (90/100).",

   "abstract": "At the German Heart Center Munich we have installed and evaluated a novel system for robotic surgery. Its main features are the\r\nincorporation of haptics (by means of strain gauge sensors at the instruments) and partial automation of surgical tasks. However,\r\nin this paper we focus on the software engineering aspects of the system. We present a hierarchical approach, which is inspired by the\r\nmodular architecture of the hardware. Each component of the system, and therefore each component of the control software can be\r\neasily interchanged by another instance (e.g. different types of robots may be employed to carry the surgical instruments). All\r\noperations are abstracted by an intuitive user interface, which provides a high level of transparency. In addition, we have included\r\ntechniques known from character animation (so called key-framing) in order to enable operation of the system by users with non-engineering\r\nbackgrounds. The introduced concepts have proven effective during an extensive evaluation with 30 surgeons. Thereby, the system was\r\nused to conduct simplified operations in the field of heart surgery, including the replacement of a papillary tendon and the occlusion\r\nof an atrial septal defect.",

     "content": "<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br /> This submission contains a GUI visualization tool for 3D and 4D images, including functions to visualize fusion, overlays, and deformation fields<br /> <br /> <strong>Open Science:</strong><br />Source code and demonstration data are included.<br /> <br /> <strong>Reproducibility:</strong><br /> Compiled from source and tested with my own data. Building is a breeze (on Linux FC9 with latest CVS versions of ITK and VTK). Testing worked well, too.<br /> <br /> <strong>Use of Open Source Software:</strong><br /> Software uses only open source toolkits.<br /> <br /> <strong>Open Source Contributions:</strong><br />Full source provided.<br /> <br /> <strong>Suggestions for future work:</strong><br /> Just a few issues I found:</p><p>* There seems to be an A/P flip in axial data (tried both Analyze and Nrrd files). A is bottom of viewer, and P is top, which is counter-intuitive.</p><p>* Nrrd should be supported as a file format (listed as a file type in the Open Deformation Field dialog) for deformation fields (certainly supported by ITK).</p><p>* Why can &quot;linked&quot; images not be overlaid and fused? It&#39;s a bit inconvenient to have to re-read an image to be able to do both linked cursors and overlay of the same second data set.</p><p>* Somehow many of the Qt widgets seem to be too small for their content (e.g., window/level entries, preset drop-down list). For the widgets just below the menu bar, the problem goes away when I maximize the application window, but the widgets in the &quot;Overlay&quot; tabfor example stay too small.</p><p>* It would be nice to have anatomical labels (&quot;A/P/L/R/I/S&quot;) displayed in the viewers for orientation. </p><p>* There does not seem to be a way to change the scale of the viewer images, while there is translate interaction using the middle mouse buttom. </p><p>* It would be useful to be able to turn the text overlay in the viewers on and off (for exporting images). </p><p> <strong>Additional Comments:</strong><br />This is certainly not as powerful a tool as others, e.g., 3DSlicer, but for what it does it is exactly right. The tool does a terrific job at what it does, without the bloating and feature overload of more complex packages. Great contribution!!<br /> <br /> </p>",

   "abstract": "Ultrasound has become a very important modality in image-guided therapy. At present, however, the collection, synchronization and transfer of ultrasonic images are more cumbersome than necessary. This paper presents a reusable solution to these problems. We propose a software package called SynchroGrab, which allows the collection of interventional ultrasound images as well as their synchronization with a stream of pose measurements. The software includes support for an open-interface ultrasound system, namely the Sonix RP, from Ultrasonix (Vancouver, Canada). Using an open-interface system like the Sonix RP allows customization of the imaging process and the capture of the ultrasound images directly from memory without the need for a frame-grabbing card. Pose measurement is currently performed with an Optotrak Certus by Northern Digital (Waterloo, Canada). However, extensibility was a primary goal in the design of this software, so the support of new devices can be achieved simply by sub-classing the relevant base class. SynchroGrab also performs reconstruction of 3D ultrasound volumes from synchronized data streams. Moreover, the recorded images, volumes and tracking information are available for visualization or further processing either directly from the file system or from a network connection compliant with the OpenIGTLink protocol, which is supported by Slicer 3.",

   "abstract": "This document describes a novel scheme for the automated extraction of the central lumen lines of\r\ncoronary arteries from computed tomography angiography (CTA) data. The scheme \ufb01rst obtains a seg-\r\nmentation of the whole coronary tree and subsequently extracts the centerlines from this segmentation.\r\nThe \ufb01rst steps of the segmentation algorithm consist of the detection of the aorta and the entire heart\r\nregion. Next, candidate coronary artery components are detected in the heart region after the masking of\r\nthe cardiac blood pools. Based on their location and geometrical properties the structures representing\r\nthe right and left arterties are selected from the candidate list. Starting from the aorta, connections\r\nbetween these structures are made resulting in a \ufb01nal segmentation of the whole coronary artery tree, A\r\nfast-marching level set method combined with a backtracking algorithm is employed to obtain the initial\r\ncenterlines within this segmentation. For all vessels a curved multiplanar reformatted image (CMPR) is\r\nconstructed and used to detect the lumen contours. The \ufb01nal centerline was then de\ufb01ned by determining\r\nthe center of gravity of the detected lumen in the transversal CMPR slices.\r\nWithin the scope of the MICCAI Challenge \"Coronary Artery Tracking 2008\", the coronary tree\r\nsegmentation and centerline extraction scheme was used to automatically detect a set of centerlines in\r\n24 datasets. For 8 data sets reference centerlines were available. This training data was used during\r\nthe development and tuning of the algorithm. Sixteen other data sets were provided as testing data.\r\nEvaluation of the proposed methodology was performed through submission of the resulting centerlines\r\nto the MICCAI Challenge website",

   "abstract": "We have created open-source Simulink block libraries for ITK and VTK that allow pipelines for these toolkits to be built in a visual, drag-and-drop style within MATLAB. Each block contains an instance of an ITK or VTK class. Any block connections and parameters that the user makes within MATLAB's Simulink visual environment are converted into connections and parameters for the ITK and VTK pipelines. In addition, we provide conversion of images to and from MATLAB arrays to allow MATLAB image processing blocks to be mixed with ITK and VTK blocks. The code for our block libraries is generated automatically from XML descriptions of the inputs, outputs, and parameters of the ITK and VTK classes. We have used these block libraries to build some example pipelines and believe that they will be useful for developing applications in image analysis and image-guided therapy.",

   "abstract": "The finite element (FE) method is a powerful tool for the study of biomechanics. One of the limiting factors in transitioning this tool into the clinic is the time required to generate high quality meshes for analysis. Previously, we developed a mapped meshing technique that utilized force control and a finite element solver to warp a template mesh onto subject specific surfaces. This paper describes a displacement based method that directly warps the template mesh onto subject specific surfaces using distance as the driving measure for the deformable registration. The resulting meshes were evaluated for mesh quality and compared to the force based method. An initial evaluation was performed using a mathematical phantom. The algorithm was then applied to generate meshes for the phalanx bones of the human hand. The algorithm successfully mapped the template bone to all of the bony surfaces, with the exception of the distal phalanx bone. In this one case, significant differences existed between the geometries of the template mesh and the distal phalanx. Further refinement of the algorithm may allow the algorithm to successfully generate meshes even in the presence of large geometric shape differences.",

   "abstract": "A novel partnership between surgeons and machines, made possible by advances in computing and engineering technology, could overcome many of the limitations of traditional surgery. By extending surgeons' ability to plan and carry out surgical interventions more accurately and with less trauma, Computer-Integrated Surgery (CIS) systems could help to improve clinical outcomes and the efficiency of health care delivery. CIS systems could have a similar impact on surgery to that long since realized in Computer-Integrated Manufacturing (CIM). Mathematical modeling and computer simulation have proved tremendously successful in engineering. Computational mechanics has enabled technological developments in virtually every area of our lives. One of the greatest challenges for mechanists is to extend the success of computational mechanics to fields outside traditional engineering, in particular to biology, the biomedical sciences, and medicine. \r\n\r\nComputational Biomechanics for Medicine Workshop series was established in 2006 with the first meeting held in Copenhagen. The third workshop was held in conjunction with the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention Conference (MICCAI 2008) in New York on 10 September 2008. It provided an opportunity for specialists in computational sciences to present and exchange opinions on the possibilities of applying their techniques to computer-integrated medicine. \r\n\r\nComputational Biomechanics for Medicine III was organized into two streams: Computational Biomechanics of Soft Tissues, and Computational Biomechanics of Tissues of Musculoskeletal System. The application of advanced computational methods to the following areas was discussed:\r\n- Medical image analysis; \r\n- Image-guided surgery; \r\n- Surgical simulation; \r\n- Surgical intervention planning; \r\n- Disease prognosis and diagnosis; \r\n- Injury mechanism analysis; \r\n- Implant and prostheses design; \r\n- Medical robotics. \r\n\r\nAfter rigorous review of full (eight-to-twelve page) manuscripts we accepted 15 papers, collected in this volume. They were split equally between podium and poster presentations. The proceedings also include abstracts of two invited lectures by world-leading researchers Professor Chwee Teck Lim from national University of Singapore and Dr. David Lloyd from The University of Western Australia.\r\n\r\nInformation about Computational Biomechanics for Medicine Workshops, including Proceedings of previous meetings is available at http://cbm.mech.uwa.edu.au/ .\r\n\r\nWe would like to thank the MICCAI 2008 organizers for help with administering the Workshop, invited lecturers for deep insights into their research fields, the authors for submitting high quality work, and the reviewers for helping with paper selection.",

A \ufb01rst step towards developing a statistical framework is establishing the basic notion of distance between tensors.

   "abstract": "The task of classifying or labeling cortical sulci is made difficult by the fact that individual sulci may not have unique distinguishing features and usually need to be identified by a multivariate feature set that takes the relative spatial arrangement into account. In this paper, classical multidimensional scaling (MDS), which gives a geometric interpretation to input dissimilarity data, is used to classify 180 sulci drawn from the ten major classes of sulci. Using a leave-one-out validation strategy, we acheive a success rate of 100% in the best case and 78% in the worst case. For these more difficult cases, we propose a second stage of classification using shape based features. One of these features is the geodesic distance between sulcal curves obtained from a new open curve representation in a geometric framework.\r\nWith MDS, we o\ufb00er a simple and intuitive approach to a challenging problem. Not only can we easily separate left and right brain sulci, but we also narrow the classification problem from, in this case, a 10-class to a 2-class problem. More generally, we can identify a region-of-interest (ROI) within which one can carry out further classification.",

   "abstract": "Abstract. Statistical shape models (SSM) capture the variation of shape across a population, in order to allow further analysis. Previous work demonstrates that deformation fields contain global transformation components, even if global pre-\r\nregistration is performed. It is crucial to construction of SSMs to remove these global transformation components from the local deformations - thus obtaining minimal deformations - prior to using these as input for SSM construction. In medical image processing, parameterized SSMs based on control points of free-form deformations (FFD) are a popular choice, since they offer several advantages compared to SSMs based on dense deformation \ufb01elds. In this work, we extend the previous approach by presenting a framework for construction of both, unparameterized and FFD-based SSMs from minimal deformations. The core of the method is computation of minimal deformations by extraction of the linear part from the original dense deformations. For FFD-based SSMs, the FFD-parameterization of the minimal deformations is performed by projection onto the space of FFDs. Both steps are computed by close-form solutions optimally in the least-square sense. The proposed method is evaluated on a data set of 62 MR images of the corpus callosum. The results show a significant improvement achieved by the proposed method for SSMs built on dense \ufb01elds, as well as on FFD-based SSMs.",

   "abstract": "The \ufb01eld of computational anatomy has developed rigorous frameworks for analyzing anatomical shape, based on diffeomorphic transformations of a template. However, differences in algorithms used for template warping, in regularization parameters, and in the template itself, lead to different representations of the same anatomy. Variations of these parameters are considered as confounding factors. Recently, extensions of the conventional computational anatomy framework to account for such confounding variations has shown that learning the equivalence class derived from the multitude of representations can lead to improved and more stable morphological descriptors. Herein, we follow that approach, estimating the morphological appearance manifold obtained by varying parameters of the template warping procedure. Our approach parallels work in the computer vision \ufb01eld, in which variations lighting, pose and other parameters leads to image appearance manifolds representing the exact same \ufb01gure in different ways. The proposed framework is then used for groupwise registration and statistical analysis of biomedical images, by employing a minimum variance criterion to perform manifold-constrained optimization, i.e. to traverse each individual\u2019s morphological appearance manifold until all individuals' representations come as close to each other as possible. E\ufb00ectively,\r\nthis process removes the aforementioned confounding e\ufb00ects and potentially leads to morphological representations re\ufb02ecting purely biological variations, instead of variations introduced by modeling assumptions and parameter settings. The nonlinearity of a morphological appearance manifold is treated via local approximations of the manifold via PCA.",

   "abstract": "In this work a minimum cost path approach is adopted to extract coronary artery centerlines from CTA data. The algorithm depends on the manual definition of the start and end point of the vessel. The cost image used in the minimal cost path approach is based on a vesselness measure and a smooth window function on intensity. In the majority of the cases the method was able to extract the centerlines successfully (overlap > 90%). Accuracy of the method is around two times the voxelsize of the datasets. To conclude, minimum cost path approaches have potential for coronary artery centerline extraction, but improvements, especially regarding the accuracy of the method, still need investigations.",

   "abstract": "Several algorithms exist for correcting the nonuniform intensity in magnetic resonance images caused by field inhomogeneities. These algorithms constitute important preprocessing steps for subsequent image analysis tasks. One such algorithm, known as parametric bias field correction (PABIC), has already been implemented in ITK. Another popular algorithm is the nonuniform intensity normalization (N3) approach. A particularly salient advantage of this algorithm is that it does not require a prior tissue model for its application. In addition, the source code for N3 is publicly available at the McConnell Brain Imaging Centre (Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University) which includes source code and the coordinating set of perl scripts. This submission describes an implementation of the N3 algorithm for the Insight Toolkit given as a single class, viz.\titk::N3MRIBiasFieldCorrectionImageFilter. We tried to maintain minimal difference between the publicly available MNI N3 implementation and our ITK im- plementation. The only intentional variation is the substitution of an earlier contribution, i.e. the class itk::BSplineScatteredDataPointSetToImageFilter, for the originally proposed least-squares approach for B-spline fitting used to model the bias field. In addition, we include a more extensive modification to the original N3 algorithm found in the class itk::N4MRIBiasFieldCorrectionImageFilter. The latter algorithm employs a multi-resolution approach, similar to FFD image registration strategies, and has a slightly modified iterative update scheme.",

   "abstract": " Branches of tubular structures (vasculature, trachea, neuron, etc.) in medical images are critical for the topology of these structures. In many applications, It is very helpful to be able to decompose tubular structures and identify every individual branch. For example, quantification of geometric vascular features, registration of trachea movement due to respiration, tracing of neuron path. However, manual decomposition can be tedious, time-consuming, and subject to operator bias. In this paper, we propose a novel method to decompose tubular structures automatically and describe how to implement it in ITK framework. The input is a 2D/3D binary image that can be obtained from any segmentation techniques, as well as the junctions, which can be generated automatically from our previously contributed ITK class: itk::JunctionDetectionFilter. The output will be branches with their labels and their connection. There are only two parameters which need to be set by the user. We provide here the implementation as a ITK class: itk::BranchDecompositionFilter.\nPlease cite the following paper if you are interested in our work.\nG. Xiong, C. Chen, J. Chen, Y. Xie, and L.

   "abstract": "An Insight Toolkit (ITK) processing framework for segmenting and tracking nuclei in time-lapse microscopy images using coupled active contours is presented in this paper. We implement the method of Dufour et al.[2] to segment and track cells in fluorescence microscopy images. The basic idea is to model the image as a constant intensity background with constant intensity foreground components. We utilizes our earlier submissions on the Chan and Vese algorithm [1] and its multiphase extension [5] to build our new tracking filter. The tracking filter itk::MultiphaseLevelSetTracking inputs a segmentation result (or a coarse estimate) from the previous time-point along with the feature image and generates a new segmentation output. By iteratively repeating this process across all time-points, real-time tracking is made possible. We include 2D/3D example code, parameter settings and show the results generated on a 2D zebrafish embryo image series.",

   "abstract": "This article provides an implementation of the symmetric log-domain diffeomorphic image registration algorithm, or symmetric demons algorithm for short. It generalizes Thirion's demons and the diffeomorphic demons algorithm. The main practical advantages of the symmetric demons with respect to the other demons variants is that is provides the inverse of the spatial transformation at no additional computational cost and ensures that the registration of image A to image B provides the inverse of the registration from image B to image A. The algorithm works completely in the log-domain, i.e. it uses a stationary velocity field to encode the spatial transformation as its exponential. Within the Insight Toolkit (ITK), the classical demons algorithm is implemented as part of the finite difference solver framework. Our code reuses and extends this generic framework. The source code is composed of a set of reusable ITK filters and classes together with their unit tests. We also provide a small example program that allows the user to compare the different variants of the demons algorithm. This paper gives an overview of the algorithm, an overview of its implementation and a small user guide to ease the use of the registration executable.",

   "abstract": "By default ITK images use a contiguous memory model. This means pixel elements are stored in a single 1-D array, where each element is adjacent in memory to the previous element. However in some situations it is not desirable to use this memory model. This document describes three alternative memory models: slice contiguous, sparse, and single-bit binary images. Slice contiguous images are three-dimensional images, in which each slice is stored in a contiguous 1-D array, but the slices are not necessarily adjacent in memory. Slice contiguous images are well suited for interoperability with applications representing images using DICOM. Sparse images are n-dimensional images, in which each pixel is stored in a hash table data structure. This memory model is well suited for images with very large dimensions, but few pixels which are actually relevant. Single-bit binary images internally represent each pixel as a single-bit, in contrast to eight-bits required to represent a boolean. Single-bit binary images allow very compact representations for on-off masks. Source code, tests, and examples are provided to allow easy reproduction and use.",

   "abstract": "In the Digital Operating Room there is a need to support data streaming to create advanced integrated surgical assist systems. In this paper we propose a DICOM-based streaming mechanism which leverages the interoperability definitions offered by DICOM to offer a common interface to manage all kinds of streaming data sources, while allowing data and application-specific protocols and infrastructure for the actual data access. We have implemented the proposed solution within the ASTMA project and have shown that thanks to the flexibility in choosing an appropriate streaming protocol we can achieve the necessary streaming quality while transmitting the context information required to create valid DICOM instances. This approach ensures an early integration of streaming data with the rest of the imaging information providing for a simpler data workflow.",

Roles, which can be seen as methods dynamically attached to objects, are embedded in components, to limit build level dependencies and improve flexibility. An appropriate component definition and composition language is proposed to declare softwares, without any specific initialization or glue code, this remaining a challenging issue in component oriented programming. The potential of this architecture is illustrated for a software coupling electromagnetic tracking with a robotized system dedicated to the physiological motion rejection in flexible endoscopy.

   "abstract": "Various frameworks and toolkits have been proposed for rapid development of computer assisted intervention (CAI) software. In this paper, we investigate how the open-source 3D Slicer application framework can be used for this purpose. We defined common requirements for CAI software to evaluate and enhance 3D Slicer for interventional applications in general. 3D Slicer is found to be an appropriate end-user deployment environment for CAI software, as its built-in functions fulfill many requirements and missing functionalities can be conveniently added. We describe the implementation of a CAI software based on extending core 3D Slicer functions. Three enhancements are described in detail: the management of workflow, DICOM image transfer, and multiple views. The resulting software fulfills general CAI requirements and supports two different MRI-guided prostate biopsy systems (each with a different imaging mode, robotic manipulator and calibration method), thereby demonstrating the usability of Slicer for implementing different CAI applications.",

While providing \nusers with the advanced, fast 3D visualization capabilities MATLAB \ndoes not provide, it is easy to learn while being \ufb02exible enough to allow \nfor complex plots, large amounts of data and combinations of visualiza- \ntions.

   "abstract": "Developing both graphical and command-line user interfaces for image analysis algorithms requires considerable effort. Generally developers provide limited to very rudimentary user interface controls to their users. These image analysis algorithms can only meet their potential if they can be used easily and frequently by their intended users. Deployment of a large suite of such algorithms on multiple platforms requires that the software be stable and appropriately tested. \n\nWe present a novel framework that allows for rapid development of image analysis algorithms along with graphical user interface controls. Additionally, our framework allows for simplified nightly testing of the algorithms to ensure stability and cross platform interoperability. It allows for development of complex algorithms by creating a custom pipeline where the output of an algorithm can serve as an input for another algorithm. All of the functionality is encapsulation into the object \nrequiring no separate source code for user interfaces, testing or deployment. This makes our framework ideal for developing novel, stable and easy-to-use algorithms for computer assisted interventions (CAI). The framework has been deployed at the Magnetic Resonance Research Center at Yale University and has been released for public use. ",

   "abstract": "To achieve longterm survival after resection of liver tumors, accurate resection margins are essential. Image guided surgery with navigational support has the potential to increase surgical accuracy significantly, thus making the operation more reliable. In this article we describe an image guided navigation system for liver surgery. Our platform uses GPU acceleration to display in real-time reconstructed 3-dimensional freehand ultrasound volumes in combination with tracked surgical instruments. We evaluated the accuracy and the performance of our system on a phantom study. The results of our study demonstrate that our image guided navigation system has the potential to introduce significant improvements in the field of liver surgery.",

   "abstract": "An open standards based modular OR integration system was designed, which is modelled as component-based service-oriented architecture. Medical devices, IT hardware, and software are integrated as independent components and interconnected through a TCP/IP based Ethernet network. The integrated system facilitates service discovery, time synchronization, systems monitoring as well as component control and network administration. Each of the components exposes its semantic information about offered services as service description to peer components. The service description object is based on a generic model and contains all information about attributes, functions, streams as well as information on the used protocols that are required to access the services. An open standards based programming library for the rapid development of server/client components including example modules was developed. A prototype setup of the entire integrated OR system was realized within a demonstrator OR lab.",

   "abstract": "Four-dimensional imaging is a necessary step in computer-assisted interventions (CAI) performed on moving surgical targets, such as those located within the beating heart or influenced by respiratory motion. Ultrasound (US) is often the best imaging modality for this application, as it provides good contrast and spatial resolution while remaining simple to integrate into the operating room. However, conventional 2D US imaging is often insufficient for preoperative planning and surgical guidance, real-time 3D ultrasound imaging using matrix array probes has a smaller field of view and lower spatial resolution, and 3D volumes created using 3D US reconstruction suffer from motion artifacts. As an alternative, gated 4D ultrasound reconstruction using a tracked 2D US probe is a promising technology. In this paper, we present SynchroGrab4D to the open-source community. SynchroGrab4D performs 3D and 4D US reconstruction in real-time while visualizing the output volume(s) within an OpenIGTLink-compliant CAI system, such as 3D Slicer. Also included are VTK classes that perform ECG-gating and that interface with several commercial tracking systems, as well as a 4D Imaging module in 3D Slicer. Our open-source imaging system can be used to collect the 4D image data required for computer-assisted surgical planning and intraoperative guidance for a variety of moving organs.",

   "abstract": "The motivation of the segmentation challenge is to quantitatively analyze global and regional cardiac function from cine magnetic resonance (MR) images, clinical parameters such as ejection fraction (EF), left ventricle myocardium mass (MM), and stroke volume (SV) are required. Calculations of these parameters depend upon accurate delineation of endocardial and epicardial contours of the left ventricle (LV). Manual delineation is time-consuming and tedious and has high inter-observer variability. Thus, fully automatic LV segmentation is desirable. \n\nThe automatic segmentation of the LV in cine MR typically faces four challenges: 1) the overlap between the intensity distributions within the cardiac regions; 2) the lack of edge information; 3) the shape variability of the endocardial and epicardial contours across slices and phases; and 4) the inter-subject variability of these factors. A number of methods have been proposed for (semi-) automatic LV segmentation, including using a probability atlas [1], dynamic programming [2-3], fuzzy clustering [4], a deformable model [5], an active appearance model [6], a variational and level set [7-10], graph cuts [11-12] and an image-driven approach [13]. For a complete review of recent literature describing cardiac segmentation techniques, see [14]. Although the segmentation results have improved, accurate LV segmentation is still acknowledged as a difficult problem.\n\nThe goals of this contest are to compare LV segmentation methods by providing an evaluation system, and a database of images and expert contours. Comparing segmentation results across research studies can be difficult due to unspecified differences in the method or implementation of evaluation metrics. This contest will provide open-source code for contour evaluation. Furthermore, the database will provide a set of images such that confounding segmentation differences due to image quality or pathology could be eliminated.",

   "abstract": "This document describes the surgical robot console system based on 3D Slicer for image-guided surgery. Considering the image-guided surgery, since image workstations have complex User Interface (UI) and extra functions, it is supposed that such UI is not suitable for surgeon who is the robot operator. The proposed robot console is designed as a simple UI for the robot operator, which can display the endoscopic video image, the sensor data, the robot status and simple images for guiding the surgery. Therefore, we expect that the surgeon can concentrate on the operation itself by utilizing the robot console. On the other hand, since the robot console system is based on 3D Slicer, the robot console can use the abundant image operation functions. Moreover, it can use the flexibility of tool connectivities by using the OpenIGTLink protocol. In addition, since the video image is captured by using the multifunctional library OpenCV , we can expect the extensibility about the function of the proposed system.",

It then automatically defines a\nVessel Region Of Interest (VROI) from the shortest path and the estimated\nvessel radius, and extracts the vessels boundaries by minimize the energy\non a corresponding graph cut.\n\nWe evaluate our method within the 2009 MICCAI 3D Segmentation Challenge for\nClinical Applications Workshop. Experimental results on the 46 carotid\nbifurcations from clinical CTAs, compared to ground-truth genrated by\naveraging three manual annotations, \nyield an average symmetric surface distance of\n0.83mm and a Dice similarity of 81.8%, with only three input seeds.\nThese results indicates that our method is easy to use, produces accurate\nsegmentations of vessels lumen, and is robust to intensity variations\ninside the vessels, radius changes, bifurcations, and nearby anatomical\nstructures with similar intensity values.",

   "abstract": "A vessel lumen centerline extraction method is presented. Its preprocessing and initialization for the application to 3D CT angiography (CTA) image volumes are also described. This approach is based upon the theory of principal curves to finding lumen axis. Meanwhile, it also estimates the lumen local width with an 1D intensity model that depicts an ideal lumen cross-sectional profile. We tested the method on 46 CTA datasets supplied with the Carotid Lumen Segmentation and Stenosis Grading Challenge (CLS) of the ``3D Segmentation in the Clinic: a Grade Challenge'', a 2009 MICCAI Workshop. The evaluation of 31 testing datasets suggests that our method can provide a good basis for post-processing if high accuracy of segmentation and stenosis grading is desired.",

   "abstract": "We propose a method for segmenting and labeling the main head and neck vessels (common, internal, external carotid and vertebral arteries) from a contrast enhanced computed tomography angiography (CTA) volume. First, an initial centerline of each vessel is extracted. Next, the vessels are segmented using 3D active objects initialized using the first step. Finally, the true centerline is identified by smoothly deforming it away from the segmented mask edges using a spline-snake. \n\nWe focus particularly on the initial centerline extraction technique. It uses a locally adaptive front propagation algorithm that attempts to find the optimal path connecting the ends of the vessel, typically from the lowest image of the scan to the Circle of Willis in the brain. It uses a patient adapted anatomical model of the different vessels both to initialize and constrain this fast marching, thus eliminating the need for manual selection of seed points. \n\nThe method is evaluated by applying it to the datasets of the MICCAI 2009 carotid bifurcation challenge, for which this paper is the only fully automatic method submitted. \n",

The method includes an adaptation of statistical shape models of the mandible, the skull base and the midfacial bones, followed by a simultaneous graph-based optimization of adjacent deformable models. The adaptation of the models to the image data is performed according to a heuristic model of the typical intensity distribution in the vincinity of the bone boundary, with special focus on an accurate discrimination of adjacent bones in joint regions. An evaluation of our method based on 18 CT scans shows that a manual correction of the automatic segmentations is not necessary in approx. 60% of the axial slices that contain the mandible.",

   "abstract": "The 2009 MICCAI Head and Neck Auto-Segmentation Challenge was aimed at assessing algorithms for automated segmentation of the brain stem and mandible from CT images for use in radiotherapy planning. The organisers provided 10 datasets with associated manual segmentations by experts, and 8 test datasets on which the algorithms had to be run. In two of the test datasets (subjects 13 and 15) the field of view was truncated. The results were independently analysed by the organisers.\n\nTo address the problem posed by the challenge we describe a method based on active appearance models (AAMs) which involves four stages: Initialisation with a parts-and-geometry model, search with a global AAM followed by search with local AAMs, then post-processing using linear regressors.\n\nApplication of the method to the test images resulted in a mean (excluding subject 13) Dice overlap value of 76.1 +/- 5.1% for the mandible, and 72.9 +/- 24.6% for the brainstem. The method failed to segment both the mandible and brainstem in subject 13, and the whilst giving a successful segmentation of the mandible in subject 15, gave poor results on the brainstem. It takes about 10 minutes to run on a 64 bit Linux workstation with 2GB RAM, and a 2GHz pentium processor. We were encouraged by its performance on this dataset, and believe that its accuracy can be improved with some modifications to the segmentation pipeline.\n",

   "abstract": "In this paper, we present an atlas-based level set automatic method for segmenting anatomical structures in head and neck CT data, such as mandible and brainstem. The proposed method is a hybrid method that combines two aspects. First, we register the atlas image to the image to be segmented using an intensity-based non-rigid image registration algorithm based on B-spline, the corresponding binary image of the atlas is also resampled into the reference image coordinate system according to the deformation field obtained from the registration process. Second, based on the initialization of the deformed atlas binary mask, the level set function is evolved to segment the object of interest in the test image. The proposed method was tested on CT images of head and neck and compared with expert segmentation of mandible and brainstem. The evaluation results show the method is available and effective.",

   "abstract": "This paper presents automated segmentation of structures in the Head and Neck (H&N) region, using an active contour-based joint registration and segmentation model. A new atlas selection strategy is also used. Segmentation is performed based on the dense deformation field computed from the registration of selected structures in the atlas image that have distinct boundaries, onto the patient's image. This approach results in robust segmentation of the structures of interest, even in the presence of tumors, or anatomical differences between the atlas and the patient image. For each patient, an atlas image is selected from the available atlas-database, based on the similarity metric value, computed after performing an affine registration between each image in the atlas-database and the patient's image. Unlike many of the previous approaches in the literature, the similarity metric is not computed over the entire image region; rather, it is computed only in the regions of soft tissue structures to be segmented. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the results is presented.",

We have chosen to exploit the tubular structure of the vessels one wants to extract to built an anisotropic metric giving higher speed on the center of the vessels and also when the minimal path tangent is coherent with the vessel\u2019s direction.

Three initial points are provided as input, belonging to the Common, the External and the Internal Carotid Arteries. Our algorithm is divided into two main steps: first, two minimal cost paths are tracked between the CCA and both the ECA and the ICA. The cost functions are based on a multiscale vesselness response. Second, after detecting the junction position and cutting or extending the paths based on the requested lengths, a level set segmentation is initialized as a thin tube around the computed paths and evolves until reaching the vessel wall or a maximal evolution time. Results on training and testing datasets are presented and compared to the manual segmentation by three observers, based on a ground truth and using four quality measures.\n",

   "abstract": "The arterial lumen is modeled by a spatially continuous right generalized cylinder with piece-wise constant parameters. The method is the identifies the parameters of each cylinder piece from a series of planar contours extracted along an approximate axis of the artery. This curve is defined by a minimal path between the artery end-points. The contours are extracted by use of a 2D Fast Marching algorithm. The identification of the axial parameters is based on a geometrical analogy with piece-wise helical curves, while the identification of the surface parameters uses the Fourier series decomposition of the contours. Thus identified parameters are used as observations in a Kalman optimal estimation scheme that manages the spatial consistency from each piece to another. The method was was evaluated on 15 training and 31 testing datasets from the MICCAI 3D Segmentation in the Clinic Grand Challenge: Carotid Bifurcation Lumen Segmentation and Stenosis Grading (http://cls2009.bigr.nl/).",

   "abstract": "The goal of the Cardiac MR Left Ventricle Segmentation Challenge at MICCAI 2009 is to compare state-of-the-art LV segmentation methods. This goal is facilitated through an evaluation system and a database of cardiac cine MR images, as well as expert contours, now freely available on the internet for research purposes. This challenge is important because the analysis and the segmentation of 3D+t sequences of MR cardiac images is fastidious, time consuming and error-prone for human operators, due to the large amount of data. Conversely, automated segmentation of cardiac images is well-known to be a challenging task.\nThis paper describes the method that our group submitted for the challenge, based on 4D discrete mathematical morphology. This method leads to discrete segmentations, i.e, binary masks (bitmaps) of the left ventricular myocardiums that are both spatially and temporally consistent.",

   "abstract": "The segmentation of left ventricular structures is necessary for the evaluation of the ejection fraction (EF) and the myocardial mass (LVM). A semi-automated 2D algorithm using connected filters and a deformable model allowing an accurate endocardial detection was proposed. The epicardial border was deduced using a deformable model restricted inside a region of interest defined from the endocardial border. Papillary muscles were detected using a fuzzy k-means algorithm. The method was applied to the challenge training and validation databases, consisting of 15 subjects each. The evaluation was performed using the tools provided by the challenge. For both datasets, results show a mean Dice metric of 0.89 for endocardial borders (0.92 for epicardial borders). Overall average perpendicular distance was 2.2 mm. Very good correlation was obtained for the EF and LVM parameters. Visual overall rating given by the challenge\u2019s cardiologist was 1.2. Segmentation was robust and performed successfully on both datasets. ",

   "abstract": "This study investigates a fully automatic left ventricle segmentation method from cine short axis MR images. Advantages of this method include that it: 1) is image-driven and does not require manually drawn initial contours. 2) provides not only endocardial and epicardial contours, but also papillary muscles and trabeculations\u2019 contours; 3) introduces a roundness measure that is fast and automatically locates the left ventricle; 4) simplifies the epicardial contour segmentation by mapping the pixels from Cartesian to approximately polar coordinates; and 5) applies a fast Fourier transform to smooth the endocardial and epicardial contours. Quantitative evaluation was performed on the 15 subjects of the MICCAI 2009 Cardiac MR Left Ventricle Segmentation hallenge. The average perpendicular distance between manually drawn and automatically selected contours over all slices, all studies, and two phases (end-diastole and end-systole) was 2.07 0.61 mm for endocardial and 1.91 0.63 mm for epicardial contours. These results indicate a promising method for automatic segmentation of left ventricle for clinical use.",

After localizing the left ventricle blood pool using motion, thresholding and clustering, slices are segmented sequentially. For each slice, deformable registration is used to align all the phases, candidate contours are recovered in the average image using shortest paths, and a minimal surface is built to generate the final contours. The advantage of our method is that the resulting contours follow the edges in each phase and are consistent over time. As part of the MICCAI grand challenge on left ventricle segmentation, we demonstrate using 15 training datasets and 15 validation datasets that the results are very good with average errors around 2 mm and the method is ready for clinical routine.",

   "abstract": "Treatment planning for high precision radiotherapy of head and neck (H&N) cancer patients requires accurate delineation of critical structures. Manual contouring is tedious and often suffers from large inter- and intra-rater variability. In this paper, we present a fully automated, atlas-based segmentation method and apply it to tackle the H&N CT image segmentation problem in the MICCAI 2009 3D Segmentation\nGrand Challenge. The proposed method employs a multiple atlas fusion strategy and a hierarchical atlas registration approach. We also exploit recent advancements in GPU technology to accelerate the deformable atlas registration and to make multi-atlas segmentation computationally feasible in practice. Validation results on the eight clinical datasets distributed by the MICCAI workshop showed that the proposed method gave very accurate segmentation of the mandible and the brainstem, with a volume\noverlap close to or above 90% for most subjects. These results suggest that our method is clinically applicable, accurate, and may significantly reduce manual labor and improve contouring efficiency.",

We present an extended Active Shape Model (ASM) formulation for the segmentation of multi-contour anatomical structures. We employ coupling and weighting schemes to improve the robustness of ASM segmentation. 3D segmentation is achieved through propagation of a 2D ASM using a learned non-rigid spatial model. This approach does not su\ufb00er from the training and aligning di\ufb03culties faced by direct 3D model-based methods. Experimental results are encouraging at this early stage, and future directions of research are provided. \n",

   "abstract": "As demonstrated by the example videos accompanying this submission of the\nmultiresolution implementation of Spherical Demons, the registration appears\nreasonable. However, we are still unable to replicate the warps from the\nstable and well verified implementation of this algorithm\nurl{http://sites.google.com/site/yeoyeo02/software/sphericaldemonsrelease}.\n\nWe find the average warp discrepancies between the original implementation and ITK\nimplementation to be about 5.3 mm on a sphere of radius 100.0 mm (note that\nwe do not expect a 100% agreement because of implementation differences, but\n5.3 mm is relatively large). The submission also includes cortical surface\nmeshes of 39 subjects and the corresponding segmentation labels of the cortical\nsurfaces. Ultimately, the best validation would be to compare the overlap of\nthese segmentation labels after registration. We welcome fellow ITK developers\nto work on this.\n\nPlease note that this ITK implementation of the algorithm is\ncurrently being reviewed and tested in the NAMIC Sandbox at:\nurl{http://svn.na-mic.org/NAMICSandBox/trunk/QuadEdgeMeshSphericalDiffeomorphicDemonsRegistration/}.\n\n\nIf you want access to the stable and well verified implementation of this\nalgorithm, please use the MATLAB code available at:\nurl{http://sites.google.com/site/yeoyeo02/software/sphericaldemonsrelease}.\n\n\nThis document describes a contribution to the Insight Toolkit intended to support the process of performing deformable registration on two Meshes. The method implemented here is restricted to Meshes with a Spherical geometry and topology, and with scalar values associated to their nodes. The code described here is an implementation of the paper \u201cSpherical Demons: Fast Diffeomorphic Landmark-Free Surface Registration\u201d by Yeo, Sabuncu, Vercauteren, Ayache, Fischl and Golland [3, 4].\n\nThis paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and output data that we used for validating the algorithm described in this paper.

The region is grown into the query pixel based only on the difference between the query pixel and neighboring pixels that are already members of the region. This allows the region to be grown along paths that change gradually over time and end up looking nothing like they originally did. This is usefully in many situation, including growing surface patches around bends using growth criteria on the normal vectors. The usage and structure of these classes follow the style of itkConnectedThresholdImageFilter. We propose these classes as addition to the Insight Toolkit.",

Therefore there is a crying need to bring about a paradigm shift in the quality of health care delivery and to monitor and sustain it. It is obvious that those institutions, which are quality conscious and are committed to continuous quality improvement, will gain the highest consumer acceptance and will flourish at the expense of others. The 'Quality Revolution', as it is sometimes referred to, is nothing but putting the patient at the heart of health care and wrapping the care around it, rather than the other way around. Quality Measuring and assessing service is important, particularly when multiple sources of variation are present. Analyzing all medical processes to remove rework and waste could build health care quality and lead to significant reductions in patient cost. The use of quality-assurance programs and statistical tools can be directly applied to health-care organizations with improved quality of patient's objectives and the results of care from the patient's viewpoint.",

Currently, manual segmentation is the gold standard for acquiring these parameters and can be time-consuming. Therefore, accuracy and automation are two important criteria in improving cardiac image segmentation methods. In this paper, we present a comprehensive approach that utilizes various features of cine MR images and combines multiple image processing methods including thresholding, edge detection, mathematical morphology, deformable model as well as image filtering. The segmentation is performed automatically with minimized interaction to optimize segmentation results. This approach provides cardiac radiologists a practical method for accurate segmentation of the left ventricle.",

The DiscreteGaussianImageFilter is then used to blur the higher dimensional image. The discrete Gaussian image filter was chosen because the kernel width used should usually be small due to the down-sampling involved when using this technique. As described in the ITK documentation, this class should outperform the recursive Gaussian algorithm due to the small kernel size DiscreteGaussianImageFilter.After the Gaussian blur has been completed the data will be interpolated and written to the output image.\n\nBy incorporating this class into the ITK framework, this more efficient algorithm will be made available to all ITK users.",

   "abstract": "Gross shape measures such as volume have been widely used in statistical analysis of anatomical structures. Statistical shape analysis methods have emerged within the last decade to allow for a localized analysis of shape. Most shape analysis frameworks are though lacking a good statistical underpinning, as they commonly do not allow for the inclusion of independent variables such as age, gender or clinical\nscores. This work presents a unified method for local shape analysis that can accomodate different number of variates and contrasts. It also allows to include any number of associated variables in the statistical analysis of the data. Several cases of study are given to clarify the explanation of the different types of data that can be analyzed and the parameters that can be used to tune the program shapeAnalysisMANCOVA. This tool has been designed to interact seamlessly with the existing UNC SPHARM-PDM based shape analysis toolbox.",

   "abstract": "In recent years, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) scanners have become more prevalent in the scientific community. They capture a \"2.5-D\" image of a scene by sending out thousands of laser pulses and using time-of-flight calculations to determine the distance to the first reflecting surface in the scene. Rather than setting up a collection of objects in real life and actually sending lasers into the scene, one can simply create a scene out of 3d models and \"scan\" it by casting rays at the models. This is a great resource for any researchers who work with 3D model/surface/point data and LiDAR data. The synthetic scanner can be used to produce data sets for which a ground truth is known in order to ensure algorithms are behaving properly before moving to \"real\" LiDAR scans. Also, noise can be added to the points to attempt to simulate a real LiDAR scan for researchers who do not have access to the very expensive equipment required to obtain real scans.",

   "abstract": "Many neuroanatomy studies rely on brain tissue segmentation in Magnetic Resonance images (MRI). The Expectation-Maximization (EM) theory offers a popular framework for this task. We studied the EM algorithm developed at the Surgical Planning Laboratory (SPL) at Harvard Medical School and implemented in the Slicer3 software. We observed that the segmentation lacks accuracy if the image exhibits some intensity inhomogeneity. Moreover the optimum parameters are challenging to estimate. This document aims at describing our solutions within the context of statistical modeling. Our contributions range from algorithm improvements to novel representations of the statistical distribution model. First we added a bias field correction module and exposed the most significant parameters. Second we proposed a new way to select the distribution of the tissues to be segmented. Finally we designed a set of interactive tools to make the segmentation process easier and more accurate. To validate the new segmentation pipeline, we performed our experiments on MRI data and a clinical expert evaluated our results.\n\nThe source code developed for this work, i.e. the code of the MRIBiasFieldCorrection and EMSegment modules, is part of Slicer3 version 3.5 and can be downloaded by this command: svn co http://svn.slicer.org/Slicer3/trunk Slicer3",

   "abstract": "An Insight Toolkit (ITK) algorithm for detection of spherical objects using Hough methods with voting is presented in this paper. Currently, the usage of Hough methods for detecting linear and circular elements exists for 2D images in ITK. The current work extends those filters in several ways. Firstly, the new filters operate on N-dimensional images. Secondly, they work in physical coordinates which is quite essential in medical imaging modalities. Thirdly, they are optimized (multi-threaded execution, stratified sampling etc.) for usage on large datasets and show a significant speedup even in 2D and on small images. Our implementation follows the same underlying mathematics of Hough transforms (as implemented by the 2D filters) but with some minor variations. The main variation lies in the pattern of voting that involves selecting voting regions easily and efficiently accessible to region iterators rather than cones that are difficult to generalize in higher dimensions. We include 2D example code, parameter settings and show the results generated on embryonic images of the zebrafish from optical microscopy.",

This is a common requirement for transferring expert manual segmentations from radiotherapy treatment planning software into external image analysis environments (such as ITK). We provide an implementation of RT structure set importing and give some example results from prostate cancer radiotherapy planning volumes. \n\nPlease note that this implementation requires GDCM 2.0 to be installed (this is trivial; however this requirement is the reason for the low automatic testing score by the Insight-Journal Dashboard).\n\nPlease Note: Updated June 2010 for a couple of minor issues (pls. see comments in .cxx) and to remove the requirement for image template. This code now reads the dcm directory and creates a 3D volume and associated binary structure volumes (all in NIfTI format).\nUsage: itkDICOMRT DicomDirectory inputDICOMRTImageFile OutputFilePrefix\n\nFeb 2013: Please note that this code won't work with ITK4 and above - instead please see: http://hdl.handle.net/10380/3401 . There is also a new test DICOM-RT directory with that paper. \n\nMar 2013 Now correctly handles holes within structures. Thanks to Sebastian Steger for the code fix.\n",

   "abstract": "An Insight Toolkit (ITK) algorithm for adaptively thresholding images is presented in this paper. Currently, the usage of thresholding methods in ITK has made use of global thresholds, confidence connected thresholds and neighborhood strategies. The current work extends these family of filters by setting thresholds adaptively in local image regions. The user is not required to specify seed regions apriori which greatly eases the task of automatic segmentation. The thresholds are determined using Otsu's minimization of between-class variances in local image regions that are selected randomly throughout the domain. Using non-uniformly sampled thresholds, a continuous function is reconstructed throughout the image domain using a B-Spline approximation algorithm. Hence, the image domain is adaptively sampled by making use of the reconstructed threshold function. Most imaging modalities introduce some intensity inhomogeneities that can be recovered by this method. ",

This workshop took place in London, UK, in September 2009, in conjunction with the 12th conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions (MICCAI). The aim of the challenge was to evaluate the performance of fully automated algorithms in segmenting the mandible and the brainstem in head and neck CT image data used in radiotherapy planning. We describe the motivation behind the clinical application selected for the challenge, the image data used, and the metrics applied for the quantitative assessment of the segmentation accuracy with respect to the ground truth segmentations provided by a clinical expert. The quantitative evaluation results of the auto-segmentations submitted by the workshop participants are included.",

   "abstract": "This document introduces a program based on the algorithm described by Maria Cristina Tugurlan. The program uses file readers, image filters, and file writers from the Insight Toolkit ITK www.itk.org. It produces as output an image whose values are the times of first arrival of a wavefront that spreads from seed points with a speed at every point equal to the input image intensity. It performs the computation in parallel on distributed memory computers using the Message Passing Interface MPI. Each MPI process reads a small piece of the input image into memory. It computes fast marching on its piece. It sends and receives the values from fast marching at piece boundaries. It recalculates fast marching a number of times set from the command line using the new boundary values each time. Each MPI process writes only a small piece of the output file.\n\nA substantial difference is seen when the output of MPI fast marching is compared to the output of serial fast marching. This difference may be acceptable for some uses. The program should be able to handle input images that are too large to fit in the memory of a single computer.",

   "abstract": "Segmentation forms the onset for image analysis especially for medical images, making any abnormalities in tissues distinctly visible. Possible application includes the detection of tumor boundary in SPECT, MRI or electron MRI (EMRI). Nevertheless, tumors being heterogeneous pose a great problem when automatic segmentation is attempted to accurately detect the region of interest (ROI). Consequently, it is a challenging task to design an automatic segmentation algorithm without the incorporation of 'a priori' knowledge of an organ being imaged. To meet this challenge, here we propose an intelligence-based approach integrating evolutionary k-means algorithm within multi-resolution framework for feature segmentation with higher accuracy and lower user interaction cost. The approach provides several advantages. First, spherical coordinate transform (SCT) is applied on original RGB data for the identification of variegated coloring as well as for significant computational overhead reduction. Second the translation invariant property of the discrete wavelet frames (DWF) is exploited to define the features, color and texture using chromaticity of LL band and luminance of LH and HL band respectively. Finally, the genetic algorithm based K-means (GKA), which has the ability to learn intelligently the distribution of different tissue types without any prior knowledge, is adopted to cluster the feature space with optimized cluster centers. \nExperimental results of proposed algorithm using multi-modality images such as MRI, SPECT, and EMRI are presented and analyzed in terms of error measures to verify its effectiveness and feasibility for medical applications.",

In a previous submission, \"A Mesh Front Iterator for VTK\", we introduced an iterator that can be used with vtkPointSet subclasses to traverse a mesh. It is sometimes useful to visit only vertices that are \"similar\" to their neighbors by some definition. This concept can be used to select many types of common regions, including planar regions or regions with similar color, to name a few. In this paper, we propose an iterator which propagates on a mesh using a condition test which can be easily modified.\n\nThe latest code is available here: https://github.com/daviddoria/MeshConditionalFrontIterator",

   "abstract": "The image registration framework in the Insight Tookit offers a powerful body of code for finding the optimal spatial transform that registers one image with another. However, ITK currently lacks a way to fit parametric models of image pixel values to an input image. This document describes new classes that enable use of the registration framework to provide this capability. We describe a new base class, itk::ParametricImageSource, that defines an interface for parametric image sources. An adapter class itk::ImageToParametricImageSourceMetric that enables itk::ParametricImageSources to be hooked into the registration framework is also described. An example adapter class that enables the existing itk::GaussianImageSource to be used for image fitting is presented, and we demonstrate use of the classes by fitting a 2D Gaussian function to an image generated by the itk::GaussianImageSource class.",

   "abstract": "Ultrasound is a very useful and convenient modality in medical imaging, due to its relatively small footprint, high resolution, negligible adverse effects, and real-time imaging capability -- in spite of its well-known artifacts. However, it is fairly difficult to fully benefit from its resolution and speed in advanced imaging research because of the closed nature of most ultrasound systems.\n\nWe propose a modular and extensible open-source toolkit MUSiiC S/W for rapid development and system setup for ultrasound research. Aimed at algorithm and experimental system builders as well as at clinical research, it allows standardized access to various types of ultrasound-derived real-time data streams, incorporates various tracking facilities, volume reconstruction, and connections to external software tools. By providing well-defined open standard interfaces between those building blocks, we aim at easy extensibility for third-party researchers.",

The majority of these systems comes from different vendors and has different user interface designs and interaction schemes. This diversity introduces a high risk of accidental misuse, which is critical in the surgical domain. The proposed framework integrates user interfaces of heterogeneous components into one central control console using a uniform screen design and interaction scheme. To accomplish this, the standards Universal Remote Console (URC) and Device Profiles for Web Services (DPWS) have been combined and integrated. The prototype results are demonstrated in the ICCAS integrated operating room.",

The shortest path computation is adapted from the algorithm in [1] to use a vesselness based weighting function. The min-cut algorithm uses the Boost graph library to calculate the minimal cut.

   "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to present our extension of the MITK toolkit by a real-time navigation system for computer assisted surgery. The system was developed with laparoscopic partial nephrectomies as a first application scenario. The main goal of the application is to enable tracking of the tumor position and orientation during surgery. Our system is based on ultrasound to CT registration and electromagnetic tracking. The basic idea is to process tracking information to generate an augmented reality (AR) visualization of a tumor model in the camera image of a laparoscopic camera. Our system will enhance the surgeon\u2019s view on the current scene and therefore facilitates higher safety during the surgery. A key intention of the development was to use only open source toolkits such as VTK, MITK and OpenCV in order to implement the desired functionality. So far we have applied our system in vitro in two phantom trials with a surgeon which yielded promising results.",

ITK already contains a \ufb01lter for resampling scalar and vector images as well as several transformation and interpolation classes. However, due to the directional nature of DT images, using the existing classes would result in losing the structural information of the image.\n We developed a new resampling \ufb01lter, speci\ufb01c to DTI, that preserves the structure by applying a rotation directly on the tensors while performing the transformation of the image. New transformation and interpolator classes have also been implemented to handle tensors correctly. The new transformation classes are based on algorithms described by D.C. Alexander et al. Finally, three \ufb01lters have been written to correct symmetric semi-de\ufb01nite matrices that would no longer be positive after the resampling process and project them into the tensors\u2019 space. In addition, a software based on the new classes has been developed and is provided with this article.",

Image samplers are useful for image registration, where samples are drawn from the fixed image in order to compute the similarity measure. Together with an image sampler base class, we introduce the following image samplers: 1) a full sampler that draws all voxel coordinates from the input image, 2) a grid sampler that draws samples from a user-specified regular voxel grid, 3 and 4) two random samplers that uniformly draw a user-specified number of samples from the input image.\n\nThis paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and output data that the authors used for validating the algorithm described in this paper.",

   "abstract": "Teleoperation is currently the dominant form of instrument control for surgical robotics. For example, the mechanical masters in the da Vinci surgical system provides a stable, precise interface for teleoperation, allowing execution of delicate tasks in complex surgical procedures. However, conventional teleoperation also adds the complexity of false feedback to the user from the interaction of the master manipulators with each other and other elements of the surgical console. Conventional teleoperation also has other inherent performance and accuracy limitations due to the mechanical devices integrated in such a system. As an alternative, we outline a hands-free system that could be improved without significant hardware redesign, and provide a sterile master workspace. Our ReachIN prototype is implemented by extending the Johns Hopkins University Surgical Assistant Workstation (SAW) framework to include additional vision interfaces and control methods. We present the design of this prototype and results from initial validation experiments.",

   "abstract": "Research and development of image guided surgery techniques requires software that provides a high degree of flexibility, with easy access to reliable functionality for common tasks. The goal of this paper is to highlight this claim in the context of image guided cardiac surgery applications. Cardiac surgery traditionally involves very invasive surgical procedures. Minimally invasive surgical techniques can greatly reduce the invasiveness of these procedures, thus reducing patient trauma. Implementing new image guidance systems for cardiac surgery is a complex process, requiring the integration of a wide variety of physical and software systems, involving both research and clinical personnel. Modular software design is essential to accommodate this complexity. Furthermore, software architecture must be highly flexible in order to facilitate both the adaptability necessary in research, and the tested reliability needed for clinical applications. Over the past decade, our laboratory has created a comprehensive system for research and development, testing and implementation of new surgical guidance techniques in the operating room. This paper provides an overview of our approach to the development and implementation of image guided therapy software for cardiovascular surgeries, ranging from the simple (needle guidance for central line access) to highly complex and experimental (intracardiac beating heart mitral valve repair/replacement).

   "abstract": "The deconvolution, also called deblurring, tries to revert the optical distortion introduced during the aquisition of the image. It is a family of image processing which can be classed in the larger family of image restoration.\nDeconvolution is a very difficult problem, and many algorithms have been proposed to solve it, with different strenght and weakness which may depend on the context where they are used. As a consequence, it is desirable to have several algorithms available when trying to restore some images. The different algorithms are often built on a similar principle, making possible to share a large part of their API in their implementation. Also, the most generic operations related to deconvolution should be reusable in order to avoid code duplication and ease the implementation of new algorithms.\n\nIn this contribution, the infrastructure for the implementation of several deconvolution algorithms is proposed. Based on this infrastructure, twelve simple deconvolution algorithms of reference are also provided.\n",

   "abstract": "The development of segmentation algorithms for liver tumors in CT scans has found growing attention in recent years. The validation of these methods, however, is often treated as a subordinate task. In this article, we review existing approaches and present \frst steps towards a new methodology that evaluates the quality of an algorithm in relation to the variability of manual delineations. We obtained three manual segmentations for 50 liver lesions and computed the results of a segmentation algorithm. We compared all four masks with each other and with different ground truth estimates and calculated scores according to the validation framework from the MICCAI challenge 2008. Our results show some cases where this more elaborate evaluation reflects the segmentation quality in a more adequate way than traditional approaches. The concepts can also be extended to other similar segmentation problems.",

Motivated by the recent popularization of the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad, in this work, we describe the set of required steps for integrating the ITK framework into Apple\u2019s iOS mobile operating system. Our focus in this paper is on the process of importing the C++ based ITK to the Objective-C based iOS, and creating a simple application that demonstrates the ITK libraries are integrated. This paper brings to the reader a user-manual on how to integrate the ITK libraries into iOS applications and code. We present here the series of steps we performed in order to import the ITK libraries as well as report the results of importing them under different versions of the iOS and under different architectures (the Simulator and Device architecture).",

   "abstract": "This document describes the use and implementation of first and second order spatial derivatives of coordinate transformations in the Insight Toolkit url{www.itk.org}). Spatial derivatives are useful for many types of regularising or penalty terms frequently used in image registration. These derivatives are dubbed 'SpatialJacobian' and 'SpatialHessian' to distinguish with the derivative to the transformation parameters themselves, which is called `Jacobian' in the ITK.\n\nIn addition to the spatial derivatives, we derived and implemented the derivatives to the registration/transform parameters of these spatial derivatives, required for gradient descent type optimisation routines. These derivatives are implemented in a sparse manner, reducing the computation time for transformations which have local support. All of these derivatives are implemented for the most common ITK coordinate transformation, such as the rigid, affine and B-spline transformation. In addition we derive formulae and code for arbitrary compositions of transformations. The spatial derivatives were subsequently exploited by implementing the bending energy penalty term.\n\nThis paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and output data that the authors used for validating the algorithm described in this paper. This adheres to the fundamental principle that scientific publications must facilitate reproducibility of the reported results.\n",

The goal of our project is to provide a quantitative definition of tumor cellularity based on the in vivo parameters. Biopsy samples obtained from previously untreated patients with a diagnosis of GBM are used to find the link between imaging parameters at the specific biopsy locations and IHC parameters from the corresponding tissue samples. A functional tree (FT) model of tumor cellularity is learned from the in vivo parameters and the remaining histological parameters. The tumor cellularity model is then tested on examples which contain only in vivo parameters, by first estimating the remaining IHC parameters by applying the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, and then using the complete parameter vector for classification.",

We treat immunostaining detection as a color image analysis problem and build statistical color models using a large number of labeled positive and negative immunostaining pixels. We have implemented the statistical models in different color spaces and show that the opponent chromaticity signals effectively characterize the color distributions of the immunostaining biomarkers and that the luminance is an unreliable and distractive signal. We have applied the technique to the detection of positive P53 immunostaining in digital slides of oesophagitis and colorectal biopsies. We present experimental results and show that the technique can achieve a biomarker detection rate of over 98% with 5% false positives. ",

Such a situation occurs for instance in the case where an atlas of normal anatomy shall be matched to pathological data, such as tumors, resections or lesions. Our idea is to use local confidence weights and to model pathological regions with zero confidence. We integrate this concept into the efficient and publicly available diffeomorphic demons registration framework. Finally, we show that this process better captures deformations in high-confidence regions than without using the proposed modification. Furthermore, it is easy to implement and runs faster than previous approaches.",

The image IO could be easily extended by writing a specific image IO class for a new image file format. Whereas, there is no such framework for easily reading and writing itk::Mesh/itk::QuadEdgeMesh, At the moment, only a few specific classes to read vtk polydata format and is not easily to be extended. This paper describes our contribution to itk for providing a mesh IO framework which could be used for reading and writing some commonly used mesh file formats. The mesh IO classes worked well for both itk::Mesh and itk::QuadEdgeMesh.",

   "abstract": "We have created a wrapper package named SimVTK that allows VTK, and third-party classes derived from VTK classes, to be seamlessly integrated with MATLAB's Simulink interface. Our package generates a loadable Simulink module for each VTK class, which is then represented as a \"block\" on the Simulink canvas, and can be connected with other blocks to form a pipeline. Each block can be double-clicked to bring up a dialog box that allows introspection and control of the VTK class. After a VTK pipeline has been built, it can be run interactively from within Simulink. The outputs of the pipeline can be displayed in an interactive render window, written to a disk file, or exported to a MATLAB variable. Within Simulink, the VTK pipeline can also be connected to the ITK pipeline through the use of our SimITK package. We generate the VTK-Simulink wrapper automatically though the use of CMake build scripts, with XML as an intermediate representation of the VTK class interfaces.\n",

   "abstract": "Recently, Birkfellner et al. proposed a novel image-to-image merit function (stochastic rank correlation, SRC) for robust intensity-based 2D/3D image registration. In this work, we summarize the basic idea of SRC, and present a generic ITK-based implementation of this image-to-image metric including tests for software veri\ufb01cation. Moreover, we provide two simple examples that demonstrate the usage of this metric: a) within the native ITK 2D/3D image registration method, and b) within a recently published extended ITK-based 2D/3D registration framework. It is, however, important to note, that this paper neither covers a comprehensive evaluation of SRC, nor a comparison with other metrics. It rather shows that SRC appears to succeed on a femoral and a porcine data set in the course of ITK-based 2D/3D image registration.\n",

   "abstract": "Topological considerations for segmentation results are important for such applications as proper brain segmentation from digital image data. We present an enhancement of the FastMarchingImageFilter which allows for topologically constrained evolution of the level set. Identical to the original functionality of the FastMarchingImageFilter, the evolution of the level set of a single or multiple genus zero, well-composed seed objects proceeds according to the specified parameters. With our proposed enhancements, the user can either choose to prevent the level set from merging with itself such that the original topology of the initial seed object(s) is not violated or that no handles are created during the evolution process. However, in contrast to earlier approaches which relied on the concept of the simple point implicitly requiring the definition of a user-specified foreground/background connectivity, we use the related, but more restrictive concept of well-composed sets to topologically constrain the evolution of the level set. Utility of our submission is demonstrated on both 2-D and 3-D brain images. Note that this submission is a companion piece to a more theoretical discussion of our work given in [9]",

The SimpleITK initiative aims to address this concern by providing an easy-access layer around ITK for non-C++ expert developers. This article proposes an alternate (perhaps complementary) approach utilizing the strategy pattern. The software design pattern known as \"strategy\" allows an algorithm to be selected from a family of algorithms on-the-fly at runtime. Because ITK consists of many such algorithm families, this particular design pattern is quite interesting. This article describes a number of algorithm families which have been identified; so far thirteen families have been implemented, encapsulating nearly 130 filters/objects. Complete source code and examples are provided to demonstrate the concept.",

This paper describes VTK classes for performing two functions: image interpolation via B-splines, and non-rigid coordinate transformation via B-splines.

The use of these classes for image deformation is demonstrated.",

In this work, we provide the software needed to simulate these volumes. Our software expects a number of physical parameters and oxygen demand maps to produce 3D volumetric images of vasculature, as well as information about the bifurcation locations, tree hierarchy and branch radii in a GXL file. We foresee our software useful for large scale evaluation studies of medical image segmentation and analysis software.",

These datasets were acquired using Synchrotron Radiation micro-Ct at the ESRF at a spatial resolution of 1.4 microns. The provided datasets were previously included in a study to develop\nnew 3D imaging methods to analyze, in three-dimensions, the morphology of microcracks\nhuman trabecular bone at the micrometric scale.\n\nThis paper is a pure data contribution. The datasets described here are made available in the public MIDAS database. Here we describe the content of the files to make easier for others to use this data as input for their own research work.

   "abstract": "This document describes an extension of the Insight Toolkit (ITK, www.itk.org) for 2D-3D registration with multiple fixed images, that is, registration of a three-dimensional dataset to a group of fixed planar projections. 2D-3D registration is possible with ITK's standard classes but with several limitations: the number of fixed images is restricted to one and the moving image's orientation axes are ignored, which greatly complicates the registration definition. Both problems are solved by the proposed framework, which permits multi-resolution intensity-based registration with an arbitrary number of fixed images, with all images defined in any orientation. In addition, the framework provides implementations of the Normalized Gradient Correlation and Pattern Intensity metrics, which are commonly used in 2D-3D registration but were not present in ITK. This article gives a detailed description of the proposed framework, along with examples that show its capabilities in registrations of real and simulated images of the spine.",

   "abstract": "There is great interest in the use of graphics processing units (GPU)for general purpose applications because the highly parallel architectures used in GPUs offer the potential for huge performance increases. The use of GPUs in image analysis applications has been under investigation for a number of years. This article describes modifications to the InsightToolkit (ITK) that provide a simple architecture for transparent use of GPU enabled filters and examples of how to write GPU enabled filters using the NVIDIA CUDA tools.\n\nThis work was performed between late 2009 and early 2010 and is being published as modifications to ITK 3.20. It is hoped that publication will help inform development of more general GPU support in ITK 4.0 and facilitate experimentation by users requiring functionality of 3.20 or wishing to pursue CUDA based developments.\n",

   "abstract": "This paper describes an integrated system for dental implantation including both preoperative planning utilizing computer-aided technology and automatic robot operation during the intra-operative stage. A novel two-step registration procedure was applied for transforming the preoperative plan to the operation of the robot, with the help of a Coordinate Measurement Machine (CMM). Experiments with a patient-specific phantom were carried out to evaluate the registration error for both position and orientation. After adopting several improvements, registration accuracy of the system was significantly improved. Sub-millimeter accuracy with the Target Registration Errors (TREs) of 0.38\u00b10.16 mm (N=5) was achieved. The target orientation errors after registration and after phantom drilling were 0.92\u00b10.16 \u00b0 (N=5) and 1.99\u00b11.27 \u00b0 (N=14), respectively. These results permit the ultimate goal of an automated robotic system for dental implantation.",

   "abstract": "Today, OR planning is supported by different clinical information systems. However, relevant patient information is distributed and spread over separate heterogeneous information systems (HIS, RIS, PACS), where each requires its own login and user interaction scheme. Furthermore, transfer of different planning data objects into the OR is currently not accomplished in a consistent electronic manner. This work proposes a framework, which integrates heterogeneous clinical information systems using a portal application with single-sign on and single-patient-lookup functionality. OR planning data can be composed into a digital planning record, which is seamlessly transferred to the modular integrated OR system. Data acquired or generated during surgery is automatically labeled with the electronic patient context, thus ensuring simple and consistent OR documentation.",

The original software architecture was a hierarchical one, based on the model-view-controller paradigm.

This allows us to integrate and test new functionality more quickly. Our work heavily utilizes the cisst libraries, developed by the Johns Hopkins University. In particular, we take advantage of cisst's multiprocess networking capabilities. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the integration of an eye-tracking based endoscope control.",

   "abstract": "Although many variations of active contour segmentation algorithms exist, most are based on solely edge criteria and breakdown or leak at weak boundaries. One solution to this problem is constraining the segmented area to only statistically possible shapes with the guidance of a shape model. The purpose of this document is to fill the void in the ITK user guide on building active shape models. We describe how to create a 2d active shape model of articular femoral knee cartilage using ITK\u2019s ImagePCAShapeModelEstimator. Sample code and example images are provided for displaying the initial principle components of variation. Shape models built with our code can be used for segmentation with itk::GeodesicActiveContourShapePriorLevelSetImageFilter.",

   "abstract": "This paper presents the rationale for the use of a component-based architecture for computer-assisted intervention (CAI) systems, including the ability to reuse components and to easily develop distributed systems. We introduce three additional capabilities, however, that we believe are especially important for research and development of CAI systems. The first is the ability to deploy components among different processes (as conventionally done) or within the same process (for optimal real-time performance), without requiring source-level modifications to the component. This is particularly relevant for real-time video processing, where the use of multiple processes could cause perceptible delays in the video stream. The second key feature is the ability to dynamically reconfigure the system. In a system composed of multiple processes on multiple computers, this allows one process to be restarted (e.g., after correcting a problem) and reconnected to the rest of the system, which is more convenient than restarting the entire distributed application and enables better fault recovery. The third key feature is the availability of run-time tools for data collection, interactive control, and introspection, and offline tools for data analysis and playback. The above features are provided by the open-source cisst software package, which forms the basis for the Surgical Assistant Workstation (SAW) framework. A complex computer-assisted intervention system for retinal microsurgery is presented as an example that relies on these features. This system integrates robotics, stereo microscopy, force sensing, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging to transcend the current limitations of vitreoretinal surgery.\n",

   "abstract": "This paper presents the design of a tele-robotic microsurgical platform designed for development of cooperative and tele-operative control schemes, sensor based smart instruments, user interfaces and new surgical techniques with eye surgery as the driving application. The system is built using the distributed component-based cisst libraries and the Surgical Assistant Workstation framework. It includes a cooperatively controlled EyeRobot2, a da Vinci Master manipulator, and a remote stereo visualization system. We use constrained optimization based virtual fixture control to provide Virtual Remote-Center-of-Motion (vRCM) and haptic feedback. Such system can be used in a hybrid setup, combining local cooperative control with remote tele-operation, where an experienced surgeon can provide hand-over-hand tutoring to a novice user. In another scheme, the system can provide haptic feedback based on virtual fixtures constructed from real-time force and proximity sensor information.",

   "abstract": "Surgery simulation is a technology based on interactive biomechanics as well as haptic and visual rendering for training novice surgeons. Another important component of a surgery simulator is the representation of a patient's anatomy in terms of simple shapes, typically triangles and tetrahedra, coinciding with relevant tissues, whose manipulation, cutting and resection is simulated. While this technology has so far emphasized generic simulators, increasingly researchers are emphasizing models that derive from the images of patients whose pathology collectively are predictive of a significant proportion of the future caseload of surgeons. In addition, our philosophy of producing patient-specific neurosurgery simulators is to organize the architecture in terms of two parameters: the choice of approach- pterional, trans-nasal, frontal and so on, and the nature of the pathology, which in turn determines the specific nature of the treatment and choice of tools. This paper describes on-going work on the refinement of an open-source software pipeline for producing patient-specific neurosurgery simulation, based on segmentation tools such as those available in Slicer and BrainVisa, surface and volume meshing, such as public VTK-based tools and Tetgen respectively, and the SOFA simulation platform. Practical requirements of the various components of the pipeline, such as resolution control and fidelity of surface and volume meshing, and interactive nonlinear mechanics in the biomechanics engine, are discussed.",

   "abstract": "As robotic surgery gains popularity [1, 2, 3], methods for improving situational awareness during tele-\noperation have become an active area of research. Literature has attempted to incorporate haptic feedback\ndisplays to enhance and improve user performance. For example, Massimino et al. [4] showed that a combi-\nnation of vibrotactile and auditory substitutions lead to task performance (peg-in hole task) comparable to\nthat using a force feedback. Kitagawa et al. [5] extended this approach by using visual force displays and\nand auditory cues, in experiments showing comparable performance in surgical tasks (knot-tying). Reiley et\nal. [6] used a visual force display in a teleoperated knot-tying task to demonstrate lower forces and reduced\nsuture breakage by trainees.\nThe above art demonstrates the need for information overlays in telerobotic surgical tasks. However, this\nliterature also used prototype software and tools intended only for the speci\fc experiments. By contrast,\nwe use the Surgical Assistant Workstation (SAW) [7, 8] in development at Johns Hopkins University to\ncreate a general information overlay, and demonstrate its utility by creating a visual warning display for\ntelerobotic surgery that detects instruments being operated outside of the \feld of view of the endoscopic\ncamera. SAW is a modular framework for rapid prototyping of new tools and methods for robotic surgery. It\nincludes methods for image guidance, registration with pre-operative and intra-operative images, and ability\nto interact with the graphical objects rendered within the display with the master or slave manipulators in\na teleoperation environment.\nThe common telesurgical system in use is the da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical Inc.). It\nconsists of a surgeon's console containing the two master manipulators, a patient side cart with up to\nfour robotic arms - three for the slave instrument manipulators which can be equipped with the removable\ninstruments and an endoscope camera manipulator connected to a high-performance stereo vision system.\nThe da Vinci also provides a research and development application programming interface (DiMaio, et al.,\n[9]) that streams kinematics data and system events at con\fgurable rates of up to 100Hz. The SAW/cisst\nframework also contains an interface to the da Vinci API.\nWe present an overlay architecture (Figure 1) implemented using the cisst/SAW libraries to integrate\ncontextual procedure and system information for improving safety, and situational awareness during these\ndelicate and complex manipulations. While the presented methods can be modi\fed for use with any robotic\nsystem, we used our da Vinci S Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical Inc.) for the validation experiments\n(Figure 2) here. Results from validation experiments with 17 users and a total of 50 training sessions\ntotaling 214350 image frames are presented.",

   "abstract": "Purpose\nThe lack of interfaces for system integration in the Operating Room (OR) has been recognized as one of the major factors to impede efficient OR turnover procedures as well as efficient intraoperative data handling and ergonomics in the OR. A software interface for application-layer connection between data processing units in the OR is presented.\nMethods\nThe requirements for data exchange in the OR were derived, mostly from the literature. A c++ class library was developed according to these requirements. The efficiency of the data exchange and the limits of the system were investigated by a series of experiments. An examplary application was built using the library to show its applicability under realistic conditions.\nResults\nWe present the software library TiCoLi for automatic OR network configuration, device and service discovery (\"surgical plug-and-play\"), message exchange, data streaming, and remote access to device parameters and functionalities through an Ethernet network. The system is based on a modular, object-oriented software design, which guarantees high flexibility regarding the adaptation of its subsystems to the needs of a particular clinical application.\nConclusions\nThe TiCoLi package is the first open source software library which was developed for system integration in the OR which covers message exchange, data streaming, and auto configuration.",

   "abstract": "In this paper, we review the technical details of new features in OpenIGTLink version 2. OpenIGTLink is a free open-source network communication protocol designed for data exchange among devices and software. Since the first release of version 1.0 protocol along with a reference C/C++ library in 2008, the number of developers and users, who use OpenIGTLink in their research projects, have been growing among convincing some commercial companies to implement research interface based on OpenIGTLink their commercial products. However, the message types initially defined for research prototypes does not cover some of functionality in commercial products, thus the protocol needed to be requires refinement in the protocol. The goal of the extension in version 2 is to support such new demands emerged after the release of the initial version, while keeping the protocol as simple as possible. The version 2 protocol has been implemented as an extension of version 1; it is backward compatible in the sense that messages generated by OpenIGTLink version 2 compliant software can be received by version 1 compliant software.

   "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nBrain tissue segmentation is important in many medical image applications. We augmented the Expectation-Maximization segmentation algorithm in Slicer3 (www.spl.harvard.edu) . Currently, in the EM Segmenter module in Slicer3 user input is necessary to set tissue-class (Gray Matter, White Matter etc.) intensity values. Our contribution to the current pipeline is to automatically compute such values using k-means clustering. Our method can be applied to scans of varying intensity profiles and thus we obviate the need for a normalization step. We applied this pipeline on multiple datasets and our method was able to accurately classify tissue-classes. The implementation was done as a standalone utility in the Python programming language (www.python.org) and work is underway to incorporate it in the EM processing pipeline. ",

   "abstract": "Ultrasound imaging is the most popular and safe diagnostic medical imaging modality. Over the past years, a considerable number of studies have been conducted on new medical ultrasound imaging modalities such as ultrasound-based elasticity imaging, photoacoustic imaging, thermal imaging, etc. Moreover, results of such advanced ultrasound research are readily integrated with Image Guided Therapy (IGT) systems due to the advantages of ultrasound imaging such as mobility and real-time data acquisition. For integrating two systems, a communication method between systems has to be devised. OpenIGTLink is a standardized TCP/IP-based protocol for the integration of medical imaging and IGT systems. However, OpenIGTLink is not sufficient for communicating between IGT and advanced ultrasound research systems, because OpenIGTLink does not define any message type for general ultrasound data and some results of ultrasound researching.\nIn this paper, we propose an extension to OpenIGTLink, called OpenIGTLinkMUSiiC, by adding new message types and new network classes. Our new message types are designed for containing raw ultrasound data, advanced ultrasound modalities, and text-based control parameters. The network classes of OpenIGTLinkMUSiiC improve upon the performance of existing network classes by implementing a multithread architecture. Finally, we present two ultrasound research applications using OpenIGTLink-MUSiiC.\n",

These algorithms find neighbors of a point in a point set that are somehow ``better'' than a ``K nearest neighbors'' or a ``all neighbors within a radius'' query. This type of nearest neighbor query is more computationally expensive, but results in set of neighbors with more desirable properties. The BSP Neighbors search ensures that there is less local duplication, while the Voronoi Neighbors search ensures that the spatial arrangement of the neighbors is as uniform as possible.\n\nThese algorithms are explained in ``Point Primitives for Interactive Modeling and Processing of 3D Geometry''.\n\nThe code is available here:\nhttps://github.com/daviddoria/SmartNearestNeighbors",

   "abstract": "The Hausdorff distance is a measure of the distance between sets of points. There are many advantages to using this metric compared to other similarity measures. This document describes a VTK class for computing the Hausdorff Distance between two sets of points. The main contribution, compared to other implementations, lies in the definition of the distance not only to the closest point but to the closest point in the represented surface, which yields an accurate measure even between undersampled surfaces. This is achieved by implementing a point-to-cell distance instead of a point-to-point. Furthermore, a plugin for ParaView was implemented, which is also available with the code. After introducing the interest of this distance, the VTK code is explained and illustrated with some examples.",

   "abstract": "In this document we present the implementation of three fuzzy clustering algorithms using the Insight Toolkit ITK. Firstly, we developed the conventional Fuzzy C-Means that will serve as the basis for the rest of the proposed algorithms. The next algorithms are the FCM with spatial constraints based on kernel-induced distance and the Modified Spatial Kernelized Fuzzy C-Means. Both of these introduce a Kernel function, replacing the Euclidean distance of the FCM, and spatial information into the membership function.\n\nThese algorithms have been implemented in a threaded version to take advantage of the multicore processors. Moreover, providing an useful implementation make it possible that classes work with 2D/3D images, different kernels and spatial shapes.\n\nWe included the source code as well as different 2D/3D examples, using several input parameters for the algorithms and obtaining the results generated on 2D/3D CT lung studies.",

   "abstract": "We have implemented filters for computing phase symmetry (PS) in ITK using steerable filters computed and applied in the Fourier domain. In some recent publications, phase symmetry has been shown to be a useful pre-processing measure for performing image registration and segmentation. Matlab implementations of the code are currently available, but may be slower than C++ versions and most importantly, do not work with volumetric (3D) data. In this paper we briefly provide background information and list some applications of PS filters from the literature. We then provide instructions and examples of how to use the classes and executables.",

The Insight Toolkit (ITK) includes several threshold filters ranging from simple ones to Otsu based thresholding. Deep into the implementation of the Canny edge detection filter, ITK includes an implementation of hysteresis thresholding, but unfortunately this method can not be used as a generic filter.\nThis paper presents an implementation of the hysteresis thresholding filter that can be used as a standalone ITK filter.",

   "abstract": "The recent ITKv4 refactoring includes several enhancements to the existing registration framework. These additional transform classes provide access to mappings described by dense displacement fields and their corresponding optimization which complement the popular free-form deformation (FFD) ap- proach already in ITK. Innovation motivated by previous work [5] and recent diffeomorphic image regis- tration developments in which the characteristic velocity field is represented by spatiotemporal B-splines [2], resulted in a diffeomorphic B-spline-based image registration algorithm combining and extending these techniques which we make available in ITK through the gerrit system. Additionally, we include two command line tools showcasing the new elements of the registration refactoring for 1) computing mappings between two images (antsRegistration) including the family of transforms discussed in this article and 2) applying those transformations to images (antsApplyTransforms). NB: The user must download the patch available at http://review.source.kitware.com/#/c/3606/ in or- der to compile the code accompanying this article.",

Even our pairwise velocity field work continues to be refined (e.g.  http://review.source.kitware.com/#/c/7080/).

We believe this will broaden the use of ParaView for high performance computing and visualization in the medical imaging research community. The effort is focused on developing ParaView plug-ins for managing VTK structures from 3D Slicer MRML scenes and encapsulating ITK filters for deployment in ParaView. In this paper, we present KWScene, an open source cross-platform library that is being developed to support implementation of these types of plugins. We describe the overall design of the library and provide implementation details and conclude by presenting a concrete example that demonstrates the use of the KWScene library in computational anatomy research at Johns Hopkins Center for Imaging Science.",

   "abstract": "This paper describes the implementation of the LDFFD and TDFFD algorithms. Both quantify motion and deformation from an input image sequence by taking profit of the temporal dimension of velocity fields in the diffeomorphic registration framework to process the input image sequence as a single 3D+t object. The rationale behind these approaches is to formulate motion estimation in an image sequence as a multi-channel registration problem. This paper describes our implementation, currently following the original ITK registration framework without multi-threading and diffeomorphic registration framework.\nMigration to ITKv4 will be addressed in future work. We also provide code for computing strain on a segmentation represented as a VTK polydata mesh. Program usages for LDFFD and TDFFD as well as strain quantification results are given for one 3D ultrasound image sequence acquired on a healthy volunteer.",

These systems usually employ modular architectures to model the complexity involved in surgical assistance systems. Hence, standards are critical to allow for cross-framework interoperability of systems, and modules. SACAI workshop aims to establish a forum for discussing systems and architectures for computer assisted discussing intervention (CAI) applications. Continuing the success of the series, the workshop will focus on open interfaces, interoperability, and standards. In addition, this year, we will discuss clinical applications and future directions of CAI systems and frameworks. The workshop will continue to include the robust discussion between industry and academia. \n",

   "abstract": "Acquiring data sets for stereo or multi-view reconstruction with known ground truth is costly and time consuming. Freely available data sets mostly focus on specific scene conditions and might not reflect the intended application scenario. We propose a GPU accelerated ray tracing framework that allows to generate realistic images with adjustable camera properties and projection geometry. Due to the nature of ray tracing, ground truth data can easily be obtained. The system also supports projectors as used e.g. for structured light systems. This facilitates to study interaction effects between different pattern designs, camera and projector properties, as well as the utilized reconstruction algorithm.",

   "abstract": "We present preliminary results of our work to develop an augmented display for improved visualization\nof the prostate and surrounding critical anatomy for robot-assisted prostate surgery. Prostate\ncancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men in the United States. Early stage\nprostate cancer is potentially cured by surgery, which can be performed in a traditional, open fashion\nor laparoscopically. Recently, robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) using the da\nVinci surgical robot system has gained wide acceptance. Robotic systems improve surgeon dexterity\nby incorporating additional degrees of freedom at the end of the tools and offer increased precision\nand stability of movements. However, since the procedure is performed through small incisions, this\ntechnique reduces free sight and tactile feedback compared to open surgery. Surgeons also lose the ability\nto palpate the prostate to locate tumors and other critical structures such as neurovascular bundles\n(NVB). Surgeons must rely on visual cues from the video monitor and mentally correlate them with\nthe underlying anatomy, often using information from medical images obtained prior to the procedure.\nFurther complications arise from local deformations in the prostate tissue that occurs throughout the\nprostatectomy procedure due to the interaction between the surgical instruments and the prostate tissue.\nSubsequently, the anatomical model generated pre-operatively will need to be updated during the procedure\nto reflect this deformation. To address the clinical need for more accurate and reliable guidance,\nwe are developing a navigation system that provides surgeons with an augmented reality (AR) view that\nfuses a pre-operative MRI model of the prostate, tumor and surrounding tissues with the da Vinci system\nlaparoscopic video, while compensating for non-rigid prostate tissue deformation using intra-operative\ntransrectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging. The work focuses on three components: (i) Developing and\nevaluating algorithm for registration of MRI and ultrasound images (2) Building and testing an augmented\nreality, with 3D Slicer, Surgical Assistant Workstation (SAW) and the da Vinci surgical robotic\nsystem. (3) Evaluate the system using a multi-modality prostate phantom.",

   "abstract": "This paper describes the Statismo framework, which is a framework for PCA based statistical models.Statistical models are used to describe the variability of an object within a population, learned from a set of training samples. Originally developed to model shapes, statistical models are now increasingly used to model the variation in different kind of data, such as for example images, volumetric meshes or deformation fields. Statismo has been developed with the following main goals in mind: \n1) To provide generic tools for learning different kinds of PCA based statistical models, such as shape, appearance or deformations models. \n2) To make the exchange of such models easier among different research groups and to improve the reproducibility of the models. \n3) To allow for easy integration of new methods for model building into the framework. \nTo achieve the first goal, we have abstracted all the aspects that are specific to a given model and data representation, into a user defined class. This does not only make it possible to use Statismo to create different kinds of PCA models, but also allows Statismo to be used with any toolkit and data format. To facilitate data exchange, Statismo defines a storage format based on HDF5, which includes all the information necessary to use the model, as well as meta-data about the model creation, which helps to make model building reproducible. The last goal is achieved by providing a clear separation between data management, model building and model representation. In addition to the standard method for building PCA models, Statismo already includes two recently proposed algorithms for building conditional models, as well as convenience tools for facilitating cross-validation studies.\nAlthough Statismo has been designed to be independent of a particular toolkit, special efforts have been made to make it directly useful for VTK and ITK. Besides supporting model building for most data representations used by VTK and ITK, it also provides an ITK transform class, which allows for the integration of Statismo with the ITK registration framework. This leverages the efforts from the ITK project to readily access powerful methods for model fitting.",

   "abstract": "Ultrasound (US) imaging is a popular and convenient medical imaging modality thanks to its mobility, non-ionizing radiation, ease-of-use, and real-time acquisition. Conventional US imaging is frequently integrated with tracking systems and robotic systems in Image Guided Therapy (IGT) systems. Recently, these systems are also incorporating advanced US imaging such as US elasticity imaging, photoacoustic imaging, and thermal imaging. Real-time synchronous data from multiple sources and bidirectional data communication are essential for integrating components in advanced US IGT research. We previously proposed the MUSiiC ToolKit [1], a modular real-time software toolkit, and OpenIGTLinkMUSiiC [2], a standard communication protocol extended from the OpenIGTLink library [3, 4]. However, this software framework only supported real-time synchronous data from at most two sources and unidirectional communication at the software module level and class level.\n\nIn this paper, we propose MUSiiC ToolKit 2.0, an upgraded software framework for interventional advanced US research sup-porting bidirectional communication, real-time US data processing, and real-time data synchronization from multiple sources. MUSiiC ToolKit 2.0 consists of OpenIGTLink 2.0, OpenIGTlinkMUSiiC 2.0, MUSiiCNotes 2.0, and a collection of executable programs designed for US research. OpenIGTLink 2.0 is a standard TCP/IP-based protocol for the integration of medical imaging and IGT systems. OpenIGTLinkMUSiiC 2.0 is the upgraded version of OpenIGTLinkMUSiiC with new active multi-task classes, data interfaces for supporting bidirectional communication and parallel data processing. MUSiiCNotes 2.0 provides US research-oriented task classes, such as US data acquisition, beamforming, envelope detection, scan conversion, and data synchronization. Graphic User Interface (GUI) units are also available for the executable programs in MUSiiCNotes 2.0. Finally, we introduce advanced US applications based on this new software framework. \n",

   "abstract": "Modern medical imaging analyses often involve the concatenation of multiple steps, and neuroimaging analysis is no exception. The Java Image Science Toolkit (JIST) has provided a framework for both end users and engineers to synthesize processing modules into tailored, automatic multi-step processing pipelines (\u201clayouts\u201d) and rapid prototyping of module development. Since its release, JIST has facilitated substantial neuroimaging research and fulfilled much of its intended goal. However, key weaknesses must be addressed for JIST to more fully realize its potential and become accessible to an even broader community base. Herein, we identify three core challenges facing traditional JIST (JIST-I) and present the solutions in the next generation JIST (JIST-II). First, in response to community demand, we have introduced seamless data visualization; users can now click \u2018show this data\u2019 through the program interfaces and avoid the need to locating files on the disk. Second, as JIST is an open-source community effort by-design; any developer may add modules to the distribution and extend existing functionality for release. However, the large number of developers and different use cases introduced instability into the overall JIST-I framework, causing users to freeze on different, incompatible versions of JIST-I, and the JIST community began to fracture. JIST-II addresses the problem of compilation instability by performing continuous integration checks nightly to ensure community implemented changes do not negatively impact overall JIST-II functionality. Third, JIST-II allows developers and users to ensure that functionality is preserved by running functionality checks nightly using the continuous integration framework. With JIST-II, users can submit layout test cases and quality control criteria through a new GUI. These test cases capture all runtime parameters and help to ensure that the module produces results within tolerance, despite changes in the underlying architecture. These three \u201cnext generation\u201d improvements increase the fidelity of the JIST framework and enhance utility by allowing researchers to more seamlessly and robustly build, manage, and understand medical image analysis processing pipelines.",

   "abstract": "As part of the ITK v4 project efforts, we have developed ITK filters for physics-based non-rigid registration (PBNRR), which satisfies the following requirements: account for tissue properties in the registration, improve accuracy compared to rigid registration, and reduce execution time using GPU and multi-core accelerators. The implementation has three main components: (1) Feature Point Selection, (2) Block Matching (mapped to both multi-core and GPU processors), and (3) a Robust Finite Element Solver. The use of multi-core and GPU accelerators in ITK v4 provides substantial performance improvements. For example, in average for the non-rigid registration of brain MRIs, the performance of the Block Matching filter is about 12 times faster when 12 hyperthreaded multi-cores are used and about 540 times faster when the Quadro 6000 with 448 threads is used in Dell Workstation.",

In these images, the standard Chan-and-Vese levelset segmentation method may not work properly, as it assumes constant intensity distributions for foreground and background. Recently, a novel method was published that models the intensities as piece-wise smooth, and thus is more suitable to segment images with intensity homogeneities. However, this method was not yet implemented in ITK. This submission introduces our implementation of the region-scalable-fitting levelset segmentation method within the ITKv4 levelset framework.\n",

While this programming model is memory efficient, it places most of the implementation burden on the user. We provide an implementation of the Document Object Model (DOM) framework for parsing XML documents. Using this model, user code is greatly simplified, shifting most of the implementation burden from the user to the framework. \nThe provided implementation consists of two tiers. The lower level tier provides functionality for parsing XML documents and loading the tree structure into memory. It then allows the user to query and retrieve specific entries. The upper tier uses this functionality to provide an interface for mimicking a serialization and de-serialization mechanism for ITK objects. The implementation described in this document was incorporated into ITK as part of release 4.2.",

   "abstract": "In the medical simulation world the use of isosurfaces is a common action, as the information from some sources, e.g. CTs, is very well defined, and the isosurface can be easily set. Additionally, in any simulator shadows are a necessary addition to increase the users immersion as well as its depth perception. Unfortunately, the Visualization Toolkit does not offer these features, and so in this paper a modified vtkGPUVolumeRayCastMapper is presented. This modified version allows volumetric isosurface rendering as well as receiving shadows from polygons using the usual pipeline. ",

   "abstract": "We implemented the shape-based interpolation method described by Raya and Udupa in 1990 for three-dimensional images, and created two standalone filters using the Insight Toolkit ITK. The image to be interpolated must be a 3D binary image which represents an object as a series of 2D slices with pixel values at 1 inside the object and 0 outside by convention. The first filter takes as input a 3D binary image wherein the object of interest is represented in full, that is, on all contiguous slices that comprise it. Such filter yields an upsampled 3D binary image. The second filter takes as input a 3D binary image wherein the object of interest is represented only on certain slices that are regularly spaced. It yields a 3D binary image of the same size as that of the input and wherein the object is represented on all contiguous slices that comprise it. This paper is provided with the source code as well as the data used for validation.",

   "abstract": "This document describes a plug-in for Blender (www.blender.org) that allows to rasterize 3D mesh objects into 3D voxel data, i. e. it allows to voxelize Blender meshes. In 2D, this process can be compared to rasterization of vector graphics into pixel graphics. The voxelization is done by VTK (www.vtk.org) functions. A simple GUI allows to choose the type of voxelization and to specify necessary parameters. Depending on the type chosen, only the surface of the mesh objects is voxelized or the enclosed volume, i. e.\u201cfilled\u201d. Beside the size of the output, one can specify if the result should be \u201canti-aliased\u201d or not.\nThis paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and output data that the authors used for validating the script described in this paper.\n",

   "abstract": "This document describes an extension of ITK to handle both primal and dual meshes simultaneously. This paper describe in particular the data structure, an extension of itk::QuadEdgeMesh, a filter to compute and add to the the structure the dual of an existing mesh, and an adaptor which let a down- ward pipeline process the dual mesh as if it was a native itk::QuadEdgeMesh. The new data structure, itk::QuadEdgeMeshWithDual, is an extension of the already existing itk::QuadEdgeMesh, which already included by default the due topology, to handle dual geometry as well. Two types of primal meshes have been specifically illustrated: triangular / simplex meshes and Voronoi / Delaunay. A functor mechanism has been implemented to allow for different kind of computation of the dual geometry. This paper is accompanied with the source code and examples.",

In this report we explore acceleration of two time-consuming parts of a registration algorithm by means of parallel processing using the GPU. We built upon the OpenCL-based GPU image processing framework of the recent ITK4 release, and implemented Gaussian multi-resolution strategies and a general resampling framework. We evaluated the performance gain on two multi-core machines with NVidia GPUs, and compared to an existing ITK4 CPU implementation. A speedup factor of ~2-4 was realized for the multi-resolution strategies and a speedup factor of ~10-46 was achieved for resampling, for larger images (~10^8 voxels).",

The tests in the cmake file will run it for you.\r\n\r\nA couple of points\r\n1) You don\\'t have a DisconnectPipeline call in the example loop. I think this is essential for reliable use of itk filters in loops. The BinaryDilateFilter may be a mini pipeline filter and thus do the same thing internally.\r\n\r\n2) The label filters (and the parabolic filters from which they were derived) shouldn\\'t need to be run iteratively. If you want a large dilation then simply supply a large radius. This approach is much faster and will give the correct result. The problem with the iterative approach is you tend to end up with dilations that are compositions of little rectangles and are thus like a big rectangle. If you really want a dilation by a circle (which is usually the case) then use a large radius. The tests I\\'ve added show the difference between the two cases - check out looplabdilate2d.png and looplabdilate2d50.png.\r\n\r\nIf you still see problems with this test example then it may be a platform difference - I\\'ve only tested this code on linux and mac.",

     "content": "Hi\r\nI\\'ve had a play with your example. The difference isn\\'t caused by the loop - that bit appears to be working fine. It is just that the binary ball structuring element is different to the structuring element that gets used in the label dilate code. The binary ball is a bresenham circle. The label dilate code uses distance transforms internally. For a specified radius the bresenham circle is a bit bigger - a voxel that has any part less than the radius will get included in the bresenham circle. The version based on distance transforms is looking at the voxel centre - voxel centre needs to be closer than the specified radius. You can see the difference in your example if you set the iterations to 1. Neither of them do a great job of representing small spheres - thats not something that can be avoided - and the label dilate version is a little smaller. The difference grows with loop iterations.\r\n\r\nHowever there isn\\'t any need to use iterative approaches to construct a large sphere with the label code. Just use a large radius and you\\'ll get a good circle/sphere very quickly. The bianry dilate probably won\\'t be as fast. If you aren\\'t really interested in preserving labels  then check out the parabolicMorphology package also on github. Note that it assumes images with 0/1 values.",

The first pass sets the mask to a value that defines the size of the dilation - hence only the first element of the radius has any effect.\r\n\r\nIt is probably feasible to incorporate a weighting via the image spacing term - do you think this is an important capability?

Such systems can help to overcome shortcomings of the individual techniques or create new kinds of possible use cases. To ease the development of a hybrid modality we have created a generic, portable, lightweight, and easily extensible, client-server based framework, implemented in C++, to control the communication between multiple imaging and tracking devices. Our framework Computer Aided Medical Procedures Communication (CAMPCom), allows developers of hybrid systems to focus on the most important implementation aspects by freeing them from the more generic tasks of data serialization and exchange.

   "abstract": "The computation of geodesic distances on a triangle mesh has many applications in geometry processing. The fast marching method provides an approximation of the true geodesic distance field. We provide VTK classes to compute geodesics on triangulated surface meshes. This includes classes for computing the geodesic distance field from a set of seeds and to compute the geodesic curve between source and destination point(s) by back-tracking along the gradient of the distance field. The fast marching toolkit (Peyre et. al.) is internally used. A variety of options are exposed to guide front propagation including the ability to specify propagation weights, constrain to a region, specify exclusion regions, and distance based termination criteria. Interpolators that plug into a contour widget, are provided to enable interactive tracing of paths on meshes.",

   "abstract": "We present our work to develop a telerobotics research platform that provides complete access to all levels of control via open-source custom electronics and software. The electronics employs an FPGA to enable a centralized computation and distributed I/O architecture in which all control computations are implemented in a familiar development environment (Linux PC) and low-latency I/O is performed over an IEEE-1394a (Firewire) bus at speeds up to 400 Mbits/sec. The mechanical components of the system are provided by the Research Kit for the da Vinci System, which consists of the Master Tool Manipulators (MTMs), Patient Side Manipulators (PSMs), and stereo console of the first-generation da Vinci surgical robot. This system is currently installed, or planned for installation, at 11 research institutions, with additional installations likely in the future, thereby creating a research community around a common open-source hardware and software platform.",

   "abstract": "This paper is about a design policy for operation-room (OR) friendly research system, software and a software toolkit SCCToolKit for this purpose, and a few examples. Examples are image processor for endoscope, OR event detector, vision based registration of ultrasound and endoscopic images, etc. We name the design policy as Small Computations for Clinicals (SCC). A system is SCC savvy if it is 1) single purpose, 2) turn-key system without need of using mouse and keyboard, 3) small form factor PC based, and 4) cost less than $1,000 USD. SCCToolKit is OpenCV extension that could minimize the number of buffer copies from receiving image frames from operating system to render it to display buffer. It is open source under BSD license. We measured the latency of image capture to display of the endoscope image processor was between 0.13 to 0.2 second for 1920x1080 size display with chroma-key image mixing. Considering of the acceptable latency of 0.2 second, the performance was as good as commercially available, custom hardware processor that could cost over 10,000 USD, while our PC based system cost 773 USD.",

   "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a new concept of surgical navigation which processes information interactively between the real and virtual spaces, namely, updating preoperative images using the positional information of surgical tools. Although the organs are deformed by operative procedures during surgery, surgical navigation systems usually do not change the reference images that are taken prior to surgery. It is useful to generate deformed reference images during surgery while it progresses. We develop a skull base surgery navigation system that updates the preoperative images during surgery. To estimate the resected regions, our proposed system utilizes the positional information of the surgical tools that can be tracked by a surgical navigation system. Our proposed system reflects the bone removal on preoperative images by changing the voxel values of the preoperative images using the positional information of the tracked tools. The updated reference images are generated by visualizing the updated preoperative images using a volume rendering method. We evaluated the proposed system on a skull phantom created from CT images by a 3D printer. The experimental results showed that the proposed system updated the reference images in real time based on the surgical tasks including bone removal process. The accuracy of our proposed method was about 1 mm. It is very useful for surgeons to drill into such complex bone structure as the skull base.",

   "abstract": "In this paper we applied one of our regularly used processing pipelines for fully automated brain tissue segmentation. Brain tissue was segmented in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM). Our algorithms for skull stripping, tissue segmentation and white matter lesion (WML) detection were slightly adapted and applied to twelve data sets within the MRBrainS13 brain tissue segmentation challenge. Skull stripping is performed using non-rigid registration of 5 atlas masks. Our tissue segmentation is based on an automatically trained kNN-classifier. Training samples were obtained by non-rigid registration of 5 manually labeled scans followed by a pruning step in feature space to remove any residual erroneously sampled tissue voxels. The kNN-classification incorporates voxel intensities from a T1-weighted scan and a FLAIR scan. The white matter lesion detection is based on an automatically determined threshold on the FLAIR scan. The application of the algorithms on the data from the MRBrainS13 Challenge showed that our pipeline produces acceptable segmentations. Average resulting Dice scores were 77.86 (CSF), 81.22 (GM), 87.27 (WM), 93.78 (total parenchyma), and 96.26 (all intracranial structures). Total processing time was about 2 hours per subject.",

It employs a multi-atlas-based initialization from 5 training images and is tested on 12 T1w MR images provided by the MICCAI 2013 MRBrainS segmentation challenge. The registered atlas images, fully segmented into eight different brain structures, are used to formulate shape and intensity priors for a Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) energy that is subsequently minimized with a dual hierarchical max-flow computation. The algorithm makes use of a hierarchical label ordering constraint to regularize label families individually and its inherently globally optimal results guarantee robust segmentations. Major parts of the image processing pipeline are implemented using General-Purpose Programming on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU) for a substantial increase in computation speed.",

   "abstract": " A fully automatic brain segmentation method is presented. First the skull is stripped using a model-based level set on T1-weighted inversion recovery images, then the brain ventricles and basal ganglia are segmented using the same method on T1-weighted images. The central white matter is segmented using a regular level set method but with high curvature regulation. To segment the cortical gray matter, a skeleton-based model is created by extracting the mid-surface of the gray matter from a preliminary segmentation using a threshold-based level set. An implicit model is then built by defining the thickness of the gray matter to be 2.7 mm. This model is incorporated into the level set framework and used to guide a second round more precise segmentation. Preliminary experiments show that the proposed method can provide relatively accurate results compared with the segmentation done by human observers. The processing time is considerably shorter than most conventional automatic brain segmentation methods. ",

   "abstract": "We propose a new MAP-based technique for the unsupervised segmentation of different brain structures (white matter, gray matter, etc.) from T1-weighted MR brain images. In this paper, we follow a procedure like most conventional approaches, in which T1-weighted MR brain images and desired maps of regions (white matter, gray matter, etc.) are modeled by a joint Markov-Gibbs Random Field model (MGRF) of independent image signals and interdependent region labels. However, we specifically focus on the most accurate model identification that can be achieved. The proposed joint MGRF model accounts for the following three descriptors: i) a 1st-order visual appearance descriptor(empirical distribution of signal intensity), ii) a 3D probabilistic shape prior, and iii) a 3D spatially invariant 2nd-order homogeneity descriptor. To better specify the 1st-order visual appearance descriptor, each empirical distribution of signals is precisely approximated by a Linear Combination of Discrete Gaussians (LCDG) having both positive and negative components. The 3D probabilistic shape prior is learned using a subset of 3D co-aligned training T1-weighted MR brain images. The 2nd-order homogeneity descriptor is modeled by a 2nd-order translation and rotation invariant MGRF of 3D T1-weighted MR brain region labels with analytically estimated potentials. The initial segmentation, based on a 1st-order visual appearance and 3D probabilistic shape, is then iteratively refined using a 3D MGRF model with analytically estimated potentials. Experiments on twelve 3D T1-weighted MR brain images confirm the high accuracy of the proposed approach.",

   "abstract": "Segmentation of the human cerebrum from magnetic resonance images (MRI) into its component tissues has been a defining problem in medical imaging. Until recently, this has been solved as the tissue classification of the T1-weighted (T1-w) MRI, with numerous solutions for this problem having appeared in the literature. The clinical demands of understanding lesions, which are indistinguishable from gray matter in T1-w images, has necessitated the incorporation of T2-weighted Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) images to improve segmentation of the cerebrum. Many of the existing methods fail to handle the second data channel gracefully, because of assumptions about their model. In our new approach, we explore a model free algorithm which uses a classification technique based on ensembles of decision trees to learn the mapping from an image feature to the corresponding tissue label. We use corresponding image patches from a registered set of T1-w and FLAIR images with a manual segmentation to construct our decision\ntree ensembles. Our method is \u000eefficient, taking less than two minutes on a 240x240x48 volume. We conduct experiments on five training sets in a leave-one-out fashion, as well as validation on an additional twelve subjects, and a landmark validation experiment on another cohort of five\nsubjects.",

Intensity-model based classification of MR images has proven problematic. The statistical approach does not carry any spatial, textural and neighborhood information in it. We propose to use a computationally fast and novel feature-set to facilitate voxel wise classification based on regional intensity, texture, spatial location of voxels in addition to posterior probability estimates. Information available through T1-weighted (T1), T1-weighted inversion recovery (IR) and T2-weighted FLAIR (FLAIR) MRI sequences was also leveraged. An aggregate overlap of 90.21% for all intracranial structures was reported between the automatic classification and available expert annotation as measured by the DICE coefficient.",

The classification incorporates voxel intensities from a T1-weighted scan, an IR scan, and a FLAIR scan; features to encode the voxel position in the image; and Gaussian-scale-space features and Gaussian-derivative features at\nmultiple scales to facilitate a smooth segmentation.\nAn experiment on data from the MRBrainS13 brain-tissue-segmentation challenge showed that our algorithm produces reasonable segmentations in a reasonable amount of time.",

It aims for the automatic segmentation of brain into Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), Gray matter (GM) and White matter (WM). The provided dataset contains patients with white matter lesions, which makes the segmentation task more challenging. The proposed algorithm uses multi-sequence MR images to extract meaningful features and learn a Random Decision Forest that classifies each voxel of the image. The results show that it is robust to the presence of the white matter lesions, and the metrics show that the overall results are competitive.",

   "abstract": "An automated method of MR Brain image segmentation is presented. A block based Expectation Maximization method is presented for the tissue classification of MR Brain images. The standard Gaussian Mixture Model is the most widely used method for MR Brain Image Segmentation and Expectation Maximization algorithm is used to estimate the model parameters. The Gaussian Mixture Model considers each pixel as independent and does not take into account the spatial correlation between the neighbouring pixels. Hence the segmentation result obtained using standard GMM is highly sensitive to Inensity Non-Uniformity and noise. The image is divided into blocks before applying EM since the GMM is preserved in the local image blocks. Also, Nonsubsampled Contourlet Transform is employed to incorporate the spatial correlation among the neighbouring pixels. The method is applied to the 12 MR Brain volumes of MRBRAINS13 test data and the White Matter, Gray Matter and CSF structures were segmented.",

BAMS is a fully automatic unsupervised segmentation algorithm. It is based on the adaptive mean shift wherein the adaptive bandwidth of the kernel for each feature point is estimated using our proposed Bayesian approach [1]. BAMS is designed to segment the brain into three tissues; white matter (WM), gray matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The performance of the algorithm is evaluated relative to the manual segmentation (ground truth). The results of our proposed algorithm show the average Dice index 0.8377\u00b10.036 for the WM, 0.7637\u00b10.038 for the GM and 0.6835 \u00b10.023 for the CSF.",

   "abstract": "Characterization of anatomical structure of the brain and effi\fcient algorithms for automatically analyzing brain MRI have gained an increasing interest in recent years. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that automatically segments the anatomical structures of magnetic resonance human brain images. Our method uses the prior knowledge of labels given by experts to statistically investigate the spatial correspondences of brain structures in subject images. We create a multi-atlas by registering the training images to the subject image and then propagating corresponding labels to the graph of the image. Label fusion then combines these multiple labels of atlases into one label at each voxel with intensity similarity based weighted voting. Finally we cluster the graph using multiway cut in order to achieve the fi\fnal 3D segmentation of the subject image. The promising evaluation results of our segmentation method on the MRBrainS13 Test Dataset shows the effi\u000eciency and robustness of our algorithm.",

   "abstract": "In this article, we present an implementation of a flexible framework for non-parametric variational image registration, realized as part of ITK's finite difference solver hierarchy.\n\nIn a variational registration setting, the transformation is found by minimizing an energy functional that consists of (at least) two terms: a distance measure between fixed and transformed moving image and a smoothness condition for the transformation. The specific choice of these terms depends on the particular application and requires consideration of, for example, image content and imaging modalities. Following this view, the presented framework can be seen as a generalization of the demons algorithm in which two key aspects remain exchangeable: the force term (or registration function, according to the distance measure) and the regularizer (according to the smoothness condition). Moreover, two transformation models are realized: either a dense displacement field or a stationary velocity field to restrain the transformation to the space of diffeomorphisms.\n\nIn its current state, the framework includes implementations of forces based on the Sum of Squared Differences (SSD), Normalized Cross Correlation (NCC) and the demons algorithm as well as Gaussian, diffusion and elastic smoothing. However, the implementation of further components is possible and encouraged.\n",

   "abstract": "In order to guaranty performances of complex systems using numerical simulation, CEA is performing advanced data analysis and scientific visualization with open source software using High Performance Computing (HPC) capability. The diversity of the physics to study produces results of growing complexity in terms of large-scale, high dimensional and multivariate data. Moreover, the HPC approach introduces another layer of complexity by allowing computation amongst thousands of remote cores accessed from sites located hundreds of kilometers away from the computing facility.\nThis paper presents how CEA deploys and contributes to open source software to enable production class visualization tools in a high performance computing context. Among several open source projects used at CEA, this presentation will focus on Visit, VTK and Paraview.\nIn the first part we will address specific issues encountered when deploying VisIt and Paraview in a multi-site supercomputing facility for end-users. Several examples will be given on how such tools can be adapted to take advantage of a parallel setting to explore large multi-block dataset or perform remote visualization on material interface reconstructions of billions of cells. Then, the specific challenges faced to deliver Paraview\u2019s Catalyst capabilities to end-users will be discussed.\nIn the second part, we will describe how CEA contributes to open source visualization software and associated software development strategy by emphasizing on two recent development projects. The first is an integrated simulation workbench providing plugins for every step required to achieve numerical simulation independently on a local or a remote computer. Embedded in an Eclipse RCP environment, VTK views allow the users to perform data input using interaction or mesh preview before running the simulation code. Contributions to VTK have been made in order to smoothly integrate these technologies. The second details how recent developments at CEA have helped to visualize and to analyze results from ExaStamp, a parallel molecular dynamics simulation code dealing with molecular systems ranging from a few millions up to a billion atoms. These developments include a GPU intensive rendering method specialized for atoms and specific parallel algorithms to process molecular data sets.",

We introduce a new method for the automatic segmentation of parotid glands that extends existing patch-based approaches in three ways: (1) we promote the use of image features in combination with patch intensity values to increase discrimination; (2) we work with larger search windows than established methods by using an approximate nearest neighbor search; and (3) we demonstrate that location information is a crucial discriminator and add it explicitly to the description. In our experiments, we compare a large number of features and introduce a new multi-scale descriptor. The best performance is achieved with entropy image features in combination with patches and location information.",

   "abstract": "Real-time 3D echocardiography has already been shown to be an accurate tool for left ventricular (LV) volume assessment. However, LV border identification remains a challenging task, mainly because of the low contrast of the images combined with drop-out artifacts. Many (semi-)automatic algorithms have been proposed to segment the LV border, but a systematic and fair comparison between such methods has so far been impossible due to a lack of publicly available common database. The aim of this MICCAI challenge was to gather researchers around the field of LV segmentation in 3D cardiac ultrasound by providing a common database to compare algorithms directly. The proposed platform will allow a consistent evaluation and ranking of the current state-of-the-art segmentation solutions and will contribute to a faster clinical translation of groundbreaking technical advances. The purpose of this paper is to describe the technical aspects of the generation of the database, give an overview of the ranking strategy and the outline of the challenge itself.",

   "abstract": "Within the framework of the CETUS challenge, forty-five 3D echocardiographic datasets have been acquired and segmented independently by three clinical experts from different hospitals. The goal was to generate a well-established ground truth of validated expert contours on this broad range of images from different ultrasound vendors, for a number of common pathologies. Image data were acquired and segmented according to a specifically designed protocol. Since there is no clear standard or guideline for segmentation for 3DUS, we defined a tracing consensus which results in clinically acceptable and reproducible contours. Tracing was performed in four longitudinal and five transversal 3D-derived 2D planes in ED and ES. 3D contours were constructed from these tracings. If the contours or their clinical parameters differed by more than a predefined level, the tracings were compared and the experts\nwould reach a consensus interpretation on the best segmentation. One or more experts would then adapt their tracings. Final distance differences in contours were 0.77\u00b10.18mm for the training set and 0.82\u00b10.27mmfor the testing set. For the training set, 69% of contours were retraced. For the testing set, 76% of contours were retraced. The used protocol resulted in well-established ground truth contours.",

   "abstract": "In this paper, we present a fast and interactive graph cut method for 3D segmentation of the endocardial wall of the left ventricle (LV) given 3D echocardiographic images. This is a challenging task due to the poor contrast and the low signal-to-noise ratio typical of echocardiographic images. The method is carried out in 3 steps. First, 3D sampling of the LV cavity is made in a spherical-cylindrical coordinate system. Then, a gradient-based energy term is assigned to each voxel, some of which being given an infinite energy to make sure the resulting volume passes through key anatomical points. Then, a graph-cut procedure provides delineation of the endocardial surface. Results obtained on 30 exams from the 2014 CETUS MICCAI challenge dataset reveal that our method takes between 5 and 10 seconds to segment a 3D volume with an overall mean surface distance lower than 2.3 mm and an ejection fraction error of less than 5% compared to a manual tracing by an expert.",

The proposed method segments each frame independently in 90 sec, without requiring temporal information such as end-diastolic or end-systolic time points nor any registration. For better segmentation accuracy, non-local means denoising can be applied to the images at the cost of an increased run-time. The mean Dice score on the testing dataset was 84.4% without denoising and 86.4% with denoising. The originality of our approach lies in the introduction of two classes, the myocardium and the mitral valve, in addition to the left ventricle and the background classes, in order to gain contextual information for the segmentation task.",

The shape representation, unlike intensity values, provides consistent shape information across different images.

   "abstract": "Segmentation of 3D echocardiograms (3DEs) is still a challenging task due to the low signal-to-noise ratio, the limited field of view, and typical ultrasound artifacts. We propose to segment the left ventricular endocardial surface by using Active Appearance Models (AAMs). Separate end-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) AAMs were built from presegmented 3DEs of the CETUS training data and 25 previously acquired 3DEs, imaged using various 3DE equipment. The AAMs fully automatically segmented the 15 training sets in a leave-one-out cross validation, comparing two training populations and various initialization strategies. All segmentations took about 15 seconds per patient. The comparison on the CETUS training data shows that the AAM benefits from additional training data and more accurate initialization. The results on the CETUS training and testing data confirm good ED and ES segmentation accuracy on multi-center, multi-vendor, multi-pathology data, and corresponding EF estimation. Selection from different initialization strategies, based on the minimal residual error, and propagation of detected ED contours to initialize ES detection, contributed to more accurate segmentations in this heterogeneous population.",

   "abstract": "Malignant gliomas are highly heterogeneous brain tumors with complex an-\nisotropic growth patterns and occult invasion. Computational modeling of cell migration and proliferation has been subject of intensive research aiming at a deeper understanding of the tumor biology and the ability to predict growth and thus improve therapy. However, current modeling techniques follow a generative approach and make strong assumptions about underlying mechanisms. The tumor is so far treated as homogeneous entity with behavioral parameters extrapolated from previous longitudinal image information.\nWe present a novel way of approaching this problem by employing data driven, discrim-\ninative modeling techniques that learn relevant features from observed growth patterns and are able to make meaningful predictions solely on basis of local and regional tissue characteristics at one given point in time.\nWe demonstrate superior performance of the proposed discriminative method (DICE score\n83) compared to the state of the art generative approach (DICE score 72) on six patients and a total of nine different time intervals. Our approach can help estimating occult invasion as well as it can advance our understanding of the tumor biology and lead to valuable predictions of tumor growth patterns that could guide and improve radio therapy.",

   "abstract": "Purpose: Recent years have seen growing interest in adaptive radiation therapy (RT), but the existing software tools are not ideal for research use, as they are either expensive and closed proprietary applications or free open-source packages with limited scope, extensibility, reliability, or user support. To address these limitations, we have developed SlicerRT, an open-source toolkit for RT research, providing fast computations and user-friendly interface for researchers. It is a medium for RT researchers to integrate their workflows in, assists clinical translation of experimental approaches, and enables comparative testing.\n\nMethods: SlicerRT builds on the widely used medical image visualization and analysis platform, 3D Slicer (www.slicer.org). In addition to the tools that 3D Slicer offers for visualization, registration and segmentation, the toolkit provides functions specifically designed for RT research. Established development processes as well as testing and validation environment ensure software quality. Standardized software development mechanisms of 3D Slicer were applied for documentation, distribution, and user support. The design and architecture of the toolkit was outlined in [1]. SlicerRT has evolved to contain the most widely used features in the field (see www.slicerrt.org), which have been defined through consensus discussions with a large pool of RT researchers.\n\nResults: Numerous modules have been developed for RT-specific features such as DICOM-RT data import and export, as well as dose analysis tools including dose volume histogram, dose accumulation, dose comparison, and isodose line and surface generation. The toolkit also includes contour analysis modules for handling various contour representations, contour morphology, and contour comparison. Advanced registration tools are provided by the included Plastimatch library [2]. The main new features developed in the last year are RT plan and RT image import and the subject hierarchy module, which arranges the loaded data to a structure familiar to clinicians, while providing advanced automation features through the underlying extendible mechanism. The toolkit is being used by several research groups to support and evaluate adaptive radiation therapy workflows. SlicerRT is available for download through the Extension Manager component of 3D Slicer 4.3 or later (see instructions on our website).\n\nFuture work: As SlicerRT has matured to contain most of the planned functions, our focus has shifted from feature development to usability and stability. The subject hierarchy module, and its features such as bulk deformation of studies embodies our efforts toward usability, while the integration of the subject hierarchy and the advanced contour handling mechanism into the 3D Slicer core points towards stability, also benefiting the whole 3D Slicer community. There is ongoing work to evaluate and potentially standardize the way the 2D contours are rasterized into 3D volumes, thus mitigating the great variability between the different solutions for this problem. Current funding ensures continuous development for several years, so SlicerRT is expected to develop further.\n\nAcknowledgement: This work was in part funded by Cancer Care Ontario through Applied Cancer Research Unit and Research Chair in Cancer Imaging grants, and the Ontario Consortium for Adaptive Invention in Radiation Oncology (OCAIRO).\n",

   "abstract": "In radiotherapy (RT) for tumor delineation and diagnostics, complementary information of multi-modal images is used. Using high ionizing radiation, the accuracy of registered volume data is crucial; therefore a reliable and robust evaluation method for registered images is needed in clinical practice. Multi-modal image registration aligns images from different modalities like computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) into one common frame of reference. The gold standard validation methods are visual inspection by radiation oncology experts and fiducial-based evaluation. However, visual inspection is a qualitative measure with a range of 2-6 mm inaccuracy, it is time consuming and prone to errors. The fiducial-based evaluation is an invasive method when fiducial markers are fixated to bone or implanted in organs. Therefore, in clinical practice a robust non-invasive automated method is needed to validate registration of multi-modal images. \nThe aim of this study is to introduce and validate an automatic landmark-based accuracy measure for multi-modal image rigid registration using feature descriptors. A porcine dataset with fixed fiducial markers was used to compare our accuracy measure with the target registration error of fiducial markers.In addition, the robustness of our evaluation method was tested on multi-vendor database consisted of 10 brain and 20 lung cases comparing the automatic landmark accuracy measure based on feature descriptors with manual landmark based evaluation. \nAn automatic, non-invasive method based on feature descriptors for accuracy evaluation of multi-modal rigid registration was introduced. The method can be used to provide accuracy information slice-by slice on CT, CBCT and CT, MR-T1, -T2 weighted, MR-T1 contrast enhanced (ce) multi-modal images.",

   "abstract": "The goal of radiation treatment is to irradiate cancer cells (i.e., a target region) without destroying adjacent healthy tissue. Thus, it is advantageous to form the beam so that it best approximates the target, thereby reducing the amount of dose absorbed in critical regions outside the target area. While multi-leaf collimators are common in human clinical systems, small animal radiotherapy systems are typically limited to a set of fixed-size collimators. For these systems, dose painting can be used for conformal dose delivery, but is significantly slower than a multi-leaf collimator. As a compromise solution, a variable rectangular collimator has been developed for the Small Animal Radiation Research Platform (SARRP). This enables more efficient dose painting via the decomposition of a 2D target region into a minimum number of rectangles of variable size, which is the topic of this paper. The proposed method consists of several distinct steps and was implemented on the SARRP Treatment Planning System (TPS).",

   "abstract": "Patient motion during radiotherapy or intra-fractional motion, is one of the major sources of uncertainty in dose application. 2D/3D registration is an intensity based method used successfully to track tumor motion with the potential to reduce uncertainty. Despite promising results, validation remains a problem due to the lack of a gold standard. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of clinical datasets acquired with the VERO LINAC to validate intensity based 2D/3D registration. The patient considered in this study had a gold marker implanted to enable live tumor tracking. We verify our results against the tracked gold marker position. Our results show that it is possible to accurately track the tumor using only intensity based 2D/3D registration. The mean error of our registration is of 1.6 \u00b1 0.3mm and as low as 1.1 \u00b1 0.5mm when looking only at the cranial-caudal direction. The results pave the way for a possible clinical application of the method.",

   "abstract": "Automated segmentation is a frequently applied task in the course of medical imaging. Furthermore, it is a substantial component of image-guided radiotherapy. Atlas based segmentation is one of the most frequently used approach for automated segmentation. Especially for multi-atlas based segmentation, segmentation quality and speed largely depends on the underlying registration and atlas selection strategy. In this work an atlas selection strategy that is based on the correlation of inter-atlas similarities within a set of atlas images is presented. Segmentation quality is analyzed by calculating dice coefficients and 95% Hausdorff distances for the left and right parotid with respect to different numbers of atlases. Results are compared to other state of the art atlas selection strategies. It can be shown that the developed atlas selection technique performs slightly better than NMI-based selection if a low number of atlases is used.",

   "abstract": "Introduction. Computed tomography (CT) is the standard imaging modality for radiation therapy treatment planning (RTTP) because of its ability to provide information on electron density. However, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging provides superior soft tissue contrast, especially in small animal imaging, facilitating the precise selection of the target volume. This makes the technique interesting for irradiation of brain tumors. The aim of this study was to present an MR-only based workflow for RTTP on a small animal radiation research platform (SARRP) by investigating the potential of probabilistic classification of voxels using multiple MR sequences.\nMethods. Six female Fisher rats were anesthetized using isoflurane and individually fixed on an in-house made multimodality bed before starting MR and CT acquisitions. MR measurements were performed on a 7-Tesla system using a rat brain volume coil. Four different MR sequences were acquired for each animal, including a T1-weighted (MDEFT) sequence, a T2-weighted (RARE) sequence, an ultra-short echo time sequence with 20 \u03bcs echo time (UTE1) and an ultra- short echo time sequence with 2 ms echo time (UTE2). UTE offers the opportunity to acquire images from proton-poor structures with very short transverse relaxation times, such as bone, by using a rapid readout of the fast decaying signal. Following MR, the animals were moved to the SARRP to start a cone-beam CT (CB-CT) by acquiring 720 projections over 360\u00b0. Cone-beam CT projection data were reconstructed by filtered back-projection to obtain the standard-CT for RTTP. Then the images were bias field corrected and manually co-registered to the CB-CT. After that, images were segmented in three tissue classes (air, soft tissue and bone) with k-means for the CB-CT and fuzzy c-means segmentation algorithm (FCM) for the MR images with multiple MR images as input. The membership probability can be between 0 and 1, with one indicating 100% probability and zero indicating 0% probability to belong to a specific tissue class. To obtain a pseudo-CT image, voxels were assigned to the tissue class having the highest membership probability. The dice coefficient was used to evaluate the correctness of the segmentation for soft-tissue and bone. The pseudo-CT images with the highest similarity index were used for further radiotherapy treatment planning (RTTP), in addition, to the standard UTE1-UTE2. The target of the RTTP that was selected in the primary cortex (M1) and three different beam arrangements were investigated to compare CB-CT and MR-based dose calculations. The dose plans were a single static beam of 3x3 mm, using a single arc (3x3 mm beam size, 120\u00b0 arc, couch at 0\u00b0), and three non-coplanar arcs (3x3 mm beam size, 120\u00b0 arc, couch at 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0 and 90\u00b0). Dose distributions were calculated using the TPS of the SARRP and cumulative dose volume histograms (DVHs) of the target and normal brain tissue were obtained for the three dose plans.\nResults The highest dice coefficient was obtained for the T1-UTE1-T2 combination, which was used for further RTTP. The contribution of bone to the total dice coefficient did not exceed 27%. However, bone accounts for only 2% of the image, therefore a misclassified bone pixel has a bigger effect in the dice coefficient than a misclassified soft tissue pixel. Using only 1 beam, both MR combinations underestimate the dose to be delivered to the target. When more complex beam configurations were used to irradiate the target, very small differences were observed between CB-CT and MR based dose calculations.",

   "abstract": "We present a generic interpolator for label images. The basic idea is to interpolate each label with an ordinary image interpolator, and return the label with the highest value. This is the idea used by the itk::LabelImageGaussianInterpolateImageFunction interpolator. Unfortunately, this class is currently limited to Gaussian interpolation. Using generic programming, our proposed interpolator extends this idea to any image interpolator. Combined with linear interpolation, this results in similar or better accuracy and much improved computation speeds on a test image.",

One way to do this is to accelerate the optimization cost function using a parallel implementation. The purpose of this document is to provide a tutorial on how to combine the CUDA GPU computing framework with standard nonlinear optimization libraries (VNL) using CMake.

   "abstract": "Anisotropic Non-Linear Diffusion is a powerful image processing technique, which allows to simultaneously remove the noise and enhance sharp features in two or three dimensional images. Anisotropic Diffusion is understood here in the sense of Weickert, meaning that diffusion tensors are anisotropic and reflect the local orientation of image features. This is in contrast with the non-linear diffusion filter of Perona and Malik, which only involves scalar diffusion coefficients, in other words isotropic diffusion tensors. \nIn this paper, we present an anisotropic non-linear diffusion technique we implemented in ITK. This technique is based on a recent adaptive scheme making the diffusion stable and requiring limited numerical resources. ",

   "abstract": "Although phase data can take on any value, it is generally only possible to measure phase as a principle value, i.e., wrapped within the range (-pi,pi]. Determining the unwrapped phase from its principle value is a topic of considerable interest in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well as many non-medical disciplines. Despite their importance in image analysis, filters for manipulating phase information have not been incorporated into ITK. This article introduces the ITKPhase module, containing filters useful for understanding, analyzing, and unwrapping n-dimensional phase data, and also serves as a practical introduction to phase unwrapping.",

   "abstract": "The Fast Marching algorithm is an efficient numerical method for computing the distance and shortest path between points of a domain. For that purpose, it solves a front propagation problem, which can be of interest in itself. The method has numerous applications, ranging from motion planning to image segmentation. The unit of length, for computing the path length, may vary on the domain.\nMotivated by applications, we generalize the algorithm to the case where the unit of length also depends on the path direction. Segmentation methods can take advantage of this flexibility to achieve greater sensitivity and specificity, for a comparable computation time.\n",

   "abstract": "Isotropic volumetric acquisition in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is often challenging. A large number of factors such as patient or physiological motion, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), available static magnetic field B0 and total scanning\ntime limit the acquired resolution. Super-resolution (SR) is a post-processing tech-\nnique that optimally combines several anisotropic scans into a single isotropic volume that was not - or could not be - acquired in practice. If necessary conditions are met, the resulting isotropic volume offers clear improvements over the initial acquisitions such as reduced partial volume effect, oblique visualization and improved sharpness and SNR. This paper details the misoSR implementation of a SR isotropicreconstruction algorithm using the Insight Toolkit Library (ITK) library. It is a generic implementation that reconstructs an isotropic volume from any number of anisotropic volumes acquired from any orientation. The algorithm takes advantage of the inputs header information to handle the different scans properties such as field of view (FOV), resolution parameters and orientation. Step by step details on the implementation are given, parameters are individually detailed, and results are shown on different applications as an example of SR reconstruction. The algorithm is hosted on the Creatis Virtual Imaging Platform (VIP), which allows users to run misoSR without having to install the software on their system.",

   "abstract": "Deformable (2D or 3D) medical image registration is a challenging problem. Existing approaches assume that the underlying deformation is smooth. This smoothness assumption allows for solving the deformable registration at a coarse resolution and interpolate for finer resolutions. However, sliding of organs and breathing motion, exhibit discontinuities. We propose a discrete optimization approach to preserve these discontinuities. Solving continuous deformations using discrete optimization requires a fine distribution of the discrete labels. Coupled with the typical size of medical image datasets, this poses challenges to compute solutions efficiently. In this paper we present a practical, multi-scale formulation. We describe how discontinuities can be preserved, and how the optimization problem is solved. Results on synthetic 2D, and real 3D data show that we can well approximate the smoothness of continuous optimization, while accurately maintaining discontinuities.",

   "abstract": "Diff\u000buse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) is a leading technique for the detection of head and neck cancers. It can capture information regarding tissue absorption and scattering. In this research work, we propose a novel method for the identification of normal and Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) mucosa tissues using the Bag Of Words (BOW) approach. The study included 70 spectra from normal mucosa tissue sites and 70 spectra from SCC mucosa tissue sites. First, the spectra are preprocessed by extracting the useful wavelength range, denoising and reducing the inter and intra patient variability. Subsequently, features are extracted from each spectrum by continuously sliding a window with a predefined length along each spectrum to extract a group of local segments. Discrete Wavelet transform (DWT) is then employed for each segment. Next, we construct the codebook to represent each spectrum by a histogram of codewords at which each bin in the histogram is a count of a codeword appeared in the spectrum. Finally, the histogram representation is used as input for classification. The maximum accuracy reported is 94.28% with sensitivity and specificity of 91.42% and 97.14% respectively.",

   "abstract": "Transitive consistency of pairwise transformations is a desirable property of groupwise image registration procedures. The transformation synchronisation method (Bernard et al., 2015) is able to retrieve transitively consistent pairwise transformations from pairwise transformations that are initially not transitively consistent. In the present paper, we present a numerically stable implementation of the transformation synchronisation method for affine transformations, which can deal with very large translations, such as those occurring in medical images where the coordinate origins may be far away from each other. By using this method in conjunction with any pairwise (affine) image registration algorithm, a transitively consistent and unbiased groupwise image registration can be achieved.\nExperiments involving the average template generation from 3D brain images demonstrate that the method is more robust with respect to outliers and achieves higher registration accuracy compared to reference-based registration.",

   "abstract": "Very preterm birth coincides with a period of major development in the brain, with striking changes in volume, cortex folding and significant change at the microstructural level. Diffusion MRI is sensitive to motion of water on the scale of microns, allowing us to investigate some of these changes. Mapping of diffusion tensors is a challenging process, and existing methods fail to account for the major changes that take place between 30 and 40 weeks equivalent gestational age. In this paper we introduce the spectral matching in the context of non-linear registration of diffusion images. Spatial correspondences are defined with respect to the main spectral modes of the images, which are global descriptors of the tensor information. We apply tensor spectral matching (TSM) in two different ways: by estimation of spatial correspondences uniquely based on the spectral decomposition of diffusion tensor images, and by combination of TSM with a standard diffusion tensor registration algorithm (TSM-DTI-TK). We validate the proposed approaches on 20 adult controls, and we compare it to the state-of-art registration method. We then apply these methods to longitudinal diffusion data acquired from 6 extremely preterm-born infants scanned shortly after birth and at term equivalent age. The experimental results combining TSM with standard tensor registration outperform the state-of-art when applied to both adult and preterm data. Having a reliable anatomical correspondence in preterm infants allows us to quantify microstructural changes and to work towards developing biomarkers of neurological impairment.",

We propose two different GIs and study their effect on a set of subjects whose cortical surfaces are modeled with triangular meshes.",

   "abstract": "Medical image analyses rely on diverse software packages assembled into a \u201cpipeline\u201d. The Java Image Science Toolkit (JIST) has served as a standalone plugin into the Medical Image Processing Analysis and Visualization (MIPAV). We addressed shortcomings that previously prevented deeper integration of JIST with other E-science platforms. First, we developed an interface for integrating externally compiled packages (similar to the interfaces in NiPy) such that the application can become a \u201cdraggable module\u201d in the module tree. This allows for connection of inputs and outputs to other JIST modules while maintaining external processing and monitoring. Second, we develop an integration interface with the Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resources Clearinghouse Cloud Environment (NITRC-CE). User can launch and terminate pre-configured nodes to utilize computational resources of the Amazon cloud. Finally, we define a new external data source, which can connect to the eXtensible Neuroimaging Archive Toolkit (XNAT) to query and retrieve remote data using XNAT's REST API. Specifically, we define dataflow for files that can readily be converted into volumes and collections of volumes to interface with any JIST module that expects volumetric image data as an input. Users now have the ability to run their pipelines from a well-defined external data source and no longer are required to already have data on the disk. With these upgrades we have extended JIST\u2019s capabilities outside of complied java source code and enhanced capabilities to seamlessly interface with E-science platforms. ",

   "abstract": "A multi-atlas approach is proposed for the automatic segmentation of nine different structures in a set of head and neck CT images for radiotherapy. The approach takes advantage of a training dataset of 25 images to build average head and neck atlases of high-quality. By registering patient images with the atlases at the global level, structures of interest are aligned approximately in space, which allowed multi-atlas-based segmentations and correlation-based label fusion to be performed at the local level in the following steps. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations are performed on a set of 15 testing images. As shown by the results, mandible, brainstem and parotid glands are segmented accurately (mean volume DSC>0.8). The segmentation accuracy for the optic nerves is also improved over previously reported results (mean DSC above 0.61 compared with 0.52 for previous results). ",

High quality anatomical correspondences for the models are generated using a Minimum Description Length (MDL) Groupwise Image Registration method. A multi start optimisation scheme is used to robustly match the model to new images. The model has been cross validated on the training data to a good degree of accuracy, and successfully segmented all the test data. \n",

   "abstract": "We describe a segmentation method that was used in the Head and Neck Auto Segmentation Challenge held at the MICCAI 2015 conference. The algorithm consists of two building blocks. First, we employ a multi-atlas segmentation to obtain an initial segmentation for the considered organs at risk. Secondly, we use an Active Shape Model (ASM) segmentation to refine the initial segmentation of some of the organs. Leave-one-out experiments with the training data were used to determine suitable parameters for the individual steps of the segmentation. The ASM refinement resulted in improved segmentation for the optic nerves and submandibular glands, while for the brain stem, parotid glands, chiasm, and mandibular bone, the multi-atlas segmentation was preferable. Our submission achieved the second rank in the challenge.",

In recent years, the ITK developers' community has focused on providing programming interfaces to ITK from Python, Java, and Javascript and making ITK available via leading applications such as Slicer and ImageJ. In this course we present best practices for taking advantage of ITK in your imaging research and commercial products. We demonstrate how script writing and interactive GUIs can be used to access the algorithms in ITK and the multitude of ITK extensions that are freely available on the web. We also cover the opportunities and challenges with using open-source software in research and in commercial applications: from prototypes that can lead to venture capital funding to applications for first-in-human trials and ultimately for regulatory approval.",

   "abstract": "The common approach to do a fully automatic segmentation of multiple structures is an atlas or multi-atlas based solution.\nThese already have proven to be suitable for the segmentation of structures in the head and neck area and provide very accurate segmentation results, but can struggle with challenging cases with unnatural postures, where the registration of the reference patient(s) is extremely difficult.\nTherefore, we propose an coupled shape model (CoSMo) algorithm for the segmentation relevant structures in parallel. The model adaptation to a test image is done with respect to the appearance of its items and the trained articulation space. Even on very challenging data sets with unnatural postures, which occur far more often than expected, the model adaptation algorithm succeeds.\nThe approach is based on an articulated atlas \\cite{Steger2012a}, that is trained from a set of manually labeled training samples. Furthermore, we have combined the initial solution with statistical shape models \\cite{Kirschner2011} to represent structures with high shape variation. CoSMo is not tailored to specific structures or regions. It can be trained from any set of given gold standard segmentations and makes it thereby very generic.",

   "abstract": "We present a fully automatic method for segmenting mandible in CT images using anatomic landmarks and prior knowledge. The aim is to utilize spatial relationship of anatomic landmarks with image processing techniques to detect mandible robustly and efficiently. Applying prior knowledge and reliable anatomical landmarks to define an optimal Region of Interest (ROI) which contains the mandible is an effective way for fast localization and successful segmentation. This approach can be used to segment other structures such as optic nerves by defining a new set of relevant landmarks. This approach is robust to CT data with different scanner setting and does not require large training data sets.",

   "abstract": "Binary morphological operations are fundamental tools in image processing but the processing time scales with the number of pixels thus making them expensive operations on the CPU for larger 3D datasets that typically appear in medical imaging. Since erosion and dilatation are special neighborhood operators, each pixel in the output depends only on the neighborhood region which makes them fit for massive GPU parallelization. This document introduces a new ITK module that implements generic (OpenCL based) GPU accelerated binary morphology image filters for erosion and dilatation. The filter can be executed within the standard ITKGPU pipeline.",

   "abstract": "Modern medical imaging makes use of high performance computing to accelerate image acquisition, image reconstruction, image visualization and image analysis. Software libraries that provide implementations of key medical imaging algorithms need to efficiently exploit modern CPU architectures. In particular, workstations with small numbers of cores are being replaced by very high core count architectures, and by many integrated core architectures, which offer acceleration by vectorization and multi-threading.\n\nThe Insight Toolkit (ITK) is the premier open source implementation of medical imaging algorithms, with a generic design for image processing filters that allows for many developers to rapidly incorporate these algorithms in to new applications. While ITK filters benefit from a generic, platform independent multithreading capability, the current implementation is difficult to exploit to achieve very high performance. Specifically, ITK relies on a static decomposition of the image into subsets of equal size which can be highly inefficient. Threads that terminate early due to uneven work throughout the image finish early and do not contribute further to the processing of more complex regions, leading to idle computational resources and longer execution times. Performance is also difficult to coordinate across multiple algorithms, as the ITK filter assumes each filter operates independently but the global implementation has an impact across filters. \n\nIn this work, we propose a novel, simple to use, high performance multithreading capability for ITK that accelerates the itk::ImageToImageFilter. We utilise a workpile data decomposition strategy, and leave the task of optimal job scheduling on CPU cores to the library called Threading Building Blocks (TBB). We demonstrate the efficacy of multi-threading with TBB in comparison to the itk::Multithreader class, through three simple example image analysis algorithms. \n\nOur implementation provides a new multi-threaded itk::ImageToImageFilter that can be conveniently reused to provide simple and efficient multi-threaded code across applications and algorithm libraries. Our new implementation is distributed as open-source software to the community and is straightforward to adopt.",

     "content": "In this article, the authors summarize challenges related to parallelism\r\nin modern high performance computing and present improvements to the Insight\r\nToolkit (ITK) with Threading Building Blocks (TBB).\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis is that threads in many-core CPUs are starved for work given\r\nthe way that data is divided and distributed among threads. A more\r\nfine-grained and dynamic data decomposition and improved job scheduling will\r\nimprove performance.\r\n\r\nThe authors provide source code, data, and bash scripts for a quality,\r\nreproducible open science publication. Proposed improvements to ITK image\r\nprocessing filters with TBB are described, and evidence for the improvements\r\nare provided with example, realistic DWI processing.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is an excellent publication that describes the high performance\r\ncomputing challenges in ITK well and touches on an appropriate solution with\r\nTBB. While the hypothesis that performance gains are likely partially related\r\nto idle threads as proposed, much of the performance gains are also likely due\r\nto reduce overhead from spawning and destroying threads. This work has the\r\npotential to be very high impact. The improvements to a very large number of\r\nalgorithms available in ITK are significant. While the benchmarking performed\r\nwas on a 12-core Xeon system, which is a common system today, systems are coming\r\navailable, like the Knight's Landing Phi processor, which will experience\r\neven greater performance improvements.\r\n\r\nThe following improvements and next steps will ensure this work is high\r\nimpact:\r\n\r\nThe main code should be submitted to the Gerrit code review system, and\r\nimprovements should be made to ensure it works on all supported platforms,\r\nfollows ITK style guidelines, etc. This process is described here:\r\n\r\n  https://itk.org/ITKSoftwareGuide/html/Book1/ITKSoftwareGuide-Book1ch10.html\r\n\r\n\r\nIn practice, it is not possible to have a hard dependency on TBB for ITK. TBB\r\ncannot be bundled with ITK because of its size, its license, and its build\r\nsystem. It can be difficult to obtain and configure against. It does not\r\nsupport all platforms that people use with ITK. So, the addition should be an\r\noptional ITK configuration setting enabled with CMake.\r\n\r\nSince it is not practical to maintain two duplicate version of all filters,\r\nthe proposed code should be added to itk::ImageSource when TBB is available\r\nwhich will not require duplication or modification of existing filters.\r\n\r\nIt may be possible for existing filters to re-use their\r\nThreadedGenerateData method by passing the tbb::block_range::begin() value as a\r\nsubstitute for the ThreadIdType argument. While this is not the thread id, it\r\nmay fulfill the needs of how many filters, which currently use the\r\nargument to conditionally performing operations when its value is 0, perform\r\nprogress reporting, etc. An optional specialized TBB method could be\r\nimplemented by filters and used when available.\r\n\r\nIn terms of data division, another improvement would implement the proposed\r\nstrategy as an implementation of the itk::ImageRegionSplitterBase or\r\nitk::ThreadedDomainPartitioner class, and set this new class as the default when TBB\r\nis enabled. This will make it possible to override the strategy with other\r\nimplementations in the future.\r\n",

This class is accompanied by all the iterators to make it a dropin replacement for itk::Image. By changing the image typedef to itk::RLEImage, many ITK image processing algorithms build without modification and with minimal performance overhead. However, it is not possible if the user code uses GetBufferPointer() or otherwise assumes a linear pixel layout.\n\nThis class is implemented to reduce the memory use of ITK-SNAP (www.itksnap.org), so ITKSNAP is the base for measuring the quantitative results.\n\nThe class, accompanying iterator specializations, automated regression tests, and test data are all packaged as an ITK remote module https://github.com/KitwareMedical/ITKRLEImage.",

   "abstract": "Anisotropic and isotropic diffusion equations have been extensively applied on biomedical image processing for many years and a great diversity of algorithm have been proposed by the scientific community. Here, it is available a recent new implementation of the anomalous diffusion equation, based on the Fokker-Planck PDE diffusion equation (also known as the Porous Media equation). The major contribution of the anomalous process in the image processing area is the possibility to regulates a sub or super-diffusion characteristic in the noise attenuation problem, which have been showed as a suitable solution for the preservation of fine details in complex objects such as the human brain. An ITK Module is offered here in order to easily add the Anisotropic Anomalous Diffusion (AAD) and Isotropic Anomalous Diffusion (IAD) filters in the ITK hierarchy.",

This module provides classes for perturbing the positions of the vertices of either an itk::Mesh or itk::QuadEdgeMesh with Gaussian noise. This may be useful in testing the robustness of an algorithm to small changes in the input mesh, augmenting datasets for machine learning, and counteracting deleterious effects which highly regular regions of a mesh may occasionally have on mesh processing. After demonstrating basic usage, we present a practical example to show how these classes can be incorporated into a pipeline to improve mesh quality.",

The second is the multivariate joint label fusion algorithm of [4, 5] with additional extensions, denoted as \u201cjoint intensity fusion\u201d, which will be described in a forthcoming manuscript.

   "abstract": "The anisotropic diffusion algorithm has been intensively studied in the past decades, which could be considered as a very efficient image denoising procedure in many biomedical applications. Several authors contributed many clever solutions for diffusion parameters fitting in specific imaging modalities. Furthermore, besides improvements regarding the image denoising quality, one important variable that must be carefully set is the conductance, which regulates the structural edges preservation among the objects presented in the image. The conductance value is strongly dependent on image noise level and an appropriate parameter setting is, usually, difficult to find for different images databases and modalities. Fortunately, thanks to many efforts from the scientific community, a few automatic methods have been proposed in order to set the conductance value automatically. Here, it is presented an ITK class which offers a simple collection of the most common automatic conductance setting approaches in order to assist researchers in image denoising procedures using anisotropic-based filtering methods (such as well described in the AnisotropicDiffusionFunction class).",

This module contains two texture analysis filters that are used to compute feature maps of N-Dimensional images using two well-known texture analysis methods. The two filters contained in this module are itkScalarImageToTextureFeaturesImageFilter (which computes textural features based on intensity-based co-occurrence matrices in the image) and itkScalarImageToRunLengthFeaturesImageFilter (which computes textural features based on equally valued intensity clusters of different sizes or run lengths in the image). The output of this module is a vector image of the same size than the input that contains a multidimensional vector in each pixel/voxel. Filters can be configured based in the locality of the textural features (neighborhood size), offset directions for co-ocurrence and run length computation, the number of bins for the intensity histograms, the intensity range or the range of run lengths.

   "abstract": "This document describes the implementation of the external module ITKIsotropicWavelets, a multiresolution (MRA) analysis framework using isotropic and steerable wavelets in the frequency domain. This framework provides the backbone for state of the art filters for denoising, feature detection or phase analysis in N-dimensions. It focus on reusability, and highly decoupled modules for easy extension and implementation of new filters, and it contains a filter for multiresolution phase analysis,\n\nThe backbone of the multi-scale analysis is provided by an isotropic band-limited wavelet pyramid, and the detection of directional features is provided by coupling the pyramid with a generalized Riesz transform.\nThe generalized Riesz transform of order N behaves like a smoothed version of the Nth order derivatives of the signal. Also, it is steerable: its components impulse responses can be rotated to any spatial orientation, reducing computation time when detecting directional features.\n\nThis paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and\noutput data that the author used for validating the algorithm described in\nthis paper. This adheres to the fundamental principle that scientific\npublications must facilitate reproducibility of the reported results.\n",

Not sure what is the minimum version but some people reported similar errors that were solved for 4.10 maybe? (http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/community/2016-June/011491.html). This module is tested using the latest ITK (from master) and it has no errors in any platform there. Hope it helps.",

   "abstract": "The Insight Toolkit (ITK) utilizes a generic design for image processing filters that allows many developers to rapidly implement new algorithms. While ITK filters benefit from a platform-independent and versatile multithreading capability, the current implementation does not easily achieve high performance. First, ITK relies on a static decomposition of the image into subsets of equal size which is highly inefficient when the computational complexity varies between subsets (unbalanced workloads). Second, the current domain decomposition is limited to subdivide the input domain along a single dimension (typically the slice dimension in a 3-D volume), which causes a multithreading under-utilization when the number of threads is larger than the size of this dimension when using massively parallel compute systems. We previously presented a new itk::TBBImageToImageFilter class that replaced the static task decomposition by a dynamic task decomposition for improved workload balancing, in which the job scheduling task was optimized using the Intel\u00ae Threading Building Blocks (TBB) library. In this work, we propose a new multidimensional dynamic image decomposition approach that allows decomposition over an arbitrary number of dimensions. This new generic multithreading capability, combined with the TBB dynamic task scheduler, substantially improves multithreading performance when using massively parallel processors.",
