   "abstract": "In this article, we will present a novel interactive image registration technique using the 3D volumetric view as guidance throughout the registration process. The registration criterion used in this technique is the homogeneity of the color distribution on any given anatomic landmark, usually the skin/muscle voxels. This registration criterion has been validated using two different approaches, including comparison with automatic registration using mutual information based on the Insight Toolkits (ITK) and comparison with registered MR images with different pulse sequences acquired directly from the same MR scanner less than 5 minutes. An investigation is also made to compare this technique with the conventional interactive image registration using three orthogonal planar (3P) views, which is predominantly used in the current treatment planning in clinic. This 3D technique has shown several advantages, including improved registration accuracy and accelerated registration speed. It has also found that the 3P pixel registration technique often \"inherits\" a global positioning error, due to its partial 3D visual presentation. In addition, unlike the 3P technique, which generally cannot be used to register more than 2 images simultaneously and low resolution PET images, this 3D technique can register up to 4 imaging modalities simultaneously, including PET images, with both global view guidance and detail checking capability.",

The software was developed using several cross platform open-source toolkits (ITK, VTK, and FLTK). The algorithm was evaluated using a freely available digital phantom dataset provided by King's College London. The results show that the GTRACT algorithm performed significantly better than standard streamline approaches and is less affected by noise.",

   "abstract": "The usage of image processing has become an important and continuous growing field in medical imaging. Although a large amount of algorithms is available, only few are routinely applied within applications for clinical diagnosis support and treatment planning. New tools are required that allow for efficient evaluation and comparison of algorithms as well as the \r\ngeneration of dedicated user interfaces with sophisticated visualization for clinical applications. We propose a generic integration of ITK algorithms into the visual programming and rapid prototyping platform MeVisLab. One of the main limitation of ITK is its lack of visualization and interaction functionality through a dedicated development platform. MeVisLab provides a modular visual programming interface with a comprehensive suite of image processing and visualization tools. The linkage of ITK algorithms to MeVisLab is based on a two step process that consists of a generic XML description for each ITK algorithm and an automatic code generator to create new MeVisLab modules, which will be made publicly available within the free version of MeVisLab. Each module can handle different image types and data dimensions dynamically at runtime. Example applications using registration, segmentation, and visualization modules are presented in order to show the capabilities of the described integration concept.",

MITK is based on the open-source Insight Toolkit (ITK) and Visualization Toolkit (VTK) and extends them with features required for interactive systems. ITK is used for the algorithmic scope and general infrastructure, VTK for visualization. Key features of MITK are the coordination of multiple 2D and 3D visualizations of arbitrary data, a general interaction concept including undo/redo, and its extendibility and flexibility to create tailored applications due to its toolkit character and\r\ndifferent layers of hidden complexity. The paper gives a brief introduction into the overall concepts and goals of the MITK approach. Suggestions and participation are welcome. MITK is available at www.mitk.org.",

One goal of our research has been to further diversify such\r\nimage data and make it openly available to the biomedical imaging community.\r\nThe approach is to provide open access to a diverse collection\r\nof biomedical image data that can be used for the development and validation\r\nof new image processing and analysis techniques. With support\r\nfrom NLM, over 100 datasets were incorporated into the NLM-Mayo\r\ndata collection. There is variation in species, anatomy, pathology, scale,\r\nand modality. In addition to providing linical qualitymedical image\r\ndata, the collection also includes newly acquired datasets of several animals,\r\nincluding a whole mouse with both T and R data volumes.\r\nThis unique collection of data was categorized and organized into an intuitive\r\nweb-based browser which allows a user to rapidly access descriptive\r\ninformation as well as the actual data volumes. The data collection\r\nwill be made available by the NLM for distribution, vis-a-vis its Visible\r\nHuman Project (VHP). Because the landscape of biomedical imaging\r\ncontinues to change with new, advanced image acquisition systems and\r\ntechniques, continuously updating the VHP data collection seems prudent.\r\nAdditional new and varied image data will be incorporated into our\r\ncollection and disseminated to researchers in the medical image analysis\r\ncommunity.",

In this project we develop an easy-to-use interface that permits the same sequence of operations as described in Marc and Jones [1] and is based on Cell Kit developed by Marc's lab. Work products for this project include: user application software (Matlab), user manual and if possible, a web portal interface to allow internet access and application of the system. The MORPHIAS system will be implemented by means of a Matlab function which creates a GUI which allows the user to import molecular signature images (in TIFF format), and then to perform classification using a clustering algorithm, and to then perform data analysis on the result.",

   "abstract": "Open source technologies are increasing in popularity for software development. Many open source projects rely on skilled development teams whose members are distributed throughout the world. Often, agile development methods are employed by these teams, as the focus is on concurrent development and fast production over requirements management and quality assurance. The image-guided surgery toolkit (IGSTK) is an open source development project that relies on the collaboration of a skilled and distributed development team, yet addresses a domain that demands managing requirements as well as implementing a high degree of robustness and addressing safety concerns. Due to this unique cross-section of open source technology and the surgical domain, the IGSTK team has developed a set of best practices and requirements techniques to augment commonly applied agile methods. This paper presents the lessons we have learned as we have engaged in the software development process.",

   "abstract": "In this paper , we propose an extension to the National Library of Medicine's Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK. www.itk.org) with a companion image access and archival system that merges the image transfer capabilities of DICOM with DSpace (www.dspace.org), an open-source web-based digital library technology. We have extended and linked existing, freely-available DICOM and digital library software to create DICOM Accessible Digital Libraries (DADLs). Specifically, DICOM objects (and other medical image data formats such at Analyze,MetaImage) uploaded to a DADL can be grouped with other files such as journal articles or tracker data, viewed as thumbnails, and made publicly or privately available for others to search and download from a linked DICOM server. In that manner, once a researcher has identified the data he / she needs via an Internet search using meaningful descriptors, the data can be directly downloaded via standard DICOM query and retrieve utilities and that data will be perpetually indexed and accessible via an Internet handle.",

   "abstract": "Mathematical models are often used to describe natural phenomena, organisms and anatomy. This paper presents a Model-Image Registration framework that can be used to evaluate models of anatomical shape. An optimisation process is applied to the model parameters to fit the model to an organ of interest in a volumetric image. The fit is obtained by maximising a metric that measures how closely the model surface atches the image edge features, according to gradient magnitude and orientation with respect to the surface normal. The system was tested using a spiral shell model, with generated data as ground truth, and also with CT scans of the temporal bone. The parameters converge to within a close tolerance after a few hundred iterations on the test data, and show promising results on registering with the clinical data.",

This framework can be used to assist pacemaker implantation and programming in cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) that is a widely adopted therapy for heart failure patients. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering technique is performed to the time series of LV wall thickness to identify pacing site candidates. Meanwhile, pearson correlation coefficients of wall motion series show the dissimilarity between them. These main components of our clustering based prediction framework are implemented by using open source software toolkit PRTools.",

While many medical imaging applications require robust mesh generation, there are few codes available. Moreover, most of the practical implementations are commercial. The algorithm we have implemented has been previously evaluated for simulations of highly deformable objects, and the preliminary results show its applicability to the targeted application. The implementation we describe is open source and will be available within Insight Toolkit.",

   "abstract": "This paper investigates an Open Framework for Medical Simulation (named SOFA for Simulation Open Framework Architecture), and proposes ideas for structuring and supporting its expansion. Lately, through a joint effort between the Sim Group at CIMIT and the Alcove group at INRIA, we have investigated the foundations for a more extensive, flexible, and comprehensive framework. In addition, five internationally renowned research groups have contributed to this initiative by converting their algorithms into compatible modules. Although still in its very early developmental phase, the current project illustrates some of the key concepts we believe will enable collaboration and interoperability in Medical Simulation. The main objective of SOFA research is to foster collaboration among research groups. It is our hope that SOFA will simplify the development cycles, reduce production costs, and provide a means to share components through a common interface.",

   "abstract": "We have successfully created a software environment in which ultrasound data can be manipulated by, ITK (the Insight Tool-Kit), in real-time. We were able to access each frame generated within the resident computer of a TerasonTM Ultrasound Machine, convert it into the ITK image format, and demonstrate the concurrent operation of ITK on the same computer by writing the images to an external hard drive. At a rate of 10 frames per second, 512 by 512 pixel grayscale frames were written by ITK methods to the external hard drive through USB 2.0 while the ultrasound scan was occurring without thrashing or delay in system performance. This simple exercise demonstrates the potential of ITK in processing ultrasound images in real-time in addition to the more traditional off-line processing.",

   "abstract": "We have previously developed an algorithm for locating boundaries in an image with sub-pixel resolution, as well as estimating boundary width and image intensity within the adjoining objects. The algorithm operates by finding the parameters of a cumulative Gaussian curve that best approximates an intensity profile taken across a boundary. If intensity is sampled along the image gradient across a boundary, it is reasonable to assume the profile approximates a finite portion of a cumulative Gaussian. Given that assumption, the first derivative of the profile should be the corresponding portion of a Gaussian, completely described by its mean, standard deviation, and amplitude. We present here a simple and rapid method to find those parameters, given that we only have a potentially skewed sample of the Gaussian. The parameters are approximated first for the finite sample, and then both ends of the Gaussian are extrapolated using the resulting parameters. New parameters are then calculated and the procedure is repeated. The optimization rapidly converges, yielding boundary location (mean) with sub-pixel accuracy as well boundary width (standard deviation). Integration then reproduces the cumulative Gaussian, and a least-squares fit is applied to estimate the constant of integration, from which intensity of the adjoining regions can be estimated.",

   "abstract": "The gold standard for measuring muscle regeneration in muscular dystrophy therapies is counting the number of dystrophin-positive muscle fibers on a cryostat muscle section immunostained for dystrophin. The standard process of manually counting a few thousand myofibers is tedious, time consuming, and limits quantitative analysis of a therapy success. We present an unsupervised method for segmenting and counting the number of myofibers on an immunofluorescent microscopy image. The key threshold selection problem is resolved by maximizing the number of sub-threshold connected components. Components significantly smaller than the known lower bound myofiber area, the only input parameter, are ignored to reduce noise. Validation on a series of images (n=63) revealed that our algorithm varied by less than 10% from manual counts in the relevant range of operation. The algorithm allows us to quantify three-dimensional dystrophin expression and design experiments that address a major limitation in muscular dystrophy therapies, the limited distribution of dystrophin after treatment. Further we have extended this method to segment and count objects in other immunofluorescent images. The method was quickly developed and tested using the Insight Toolkit (ITK), an open source C++ library for the development of image analysis software.",

Conventional least-squares \r\nscattered data fitting techniques for B-splines require the inversion \r\nof potentially large matrices. This is time-consuming as well \r\nas susceptible to ill-conditioning which leads to undesired\r\nresults. Lee {\\em et al.} proposed a novel B-spline \r\nalgorithm for fitting a 2-D cubic B-spline surface to scattered \r\ndata in \\cite{Lee}. The proposed algorithm utilizes an \r\noptional multilevel approach for better fitting results. \r\nWe generalize this technique to support $N$-dimensional \r\ndata fitting as well as arbitrary degree of B-spline. In addition, \r\nwe generalize the B-spline kernel function class to accommodate \r\nthis new image filter.",

ITK is a powerful open-source image analysis toolkit, but it requires the knowledge of C++ to use it. With the help of MATITK, researchers familiar with MATLAB can harness the power of ITK without learning C++ and worrying about low-level programming issues. A common set of C++ classes have also been produced to allow future ITK methods to be added to MATITK therefore callable in MATLAB without the bothersome translation between MATLAB and ITK.",

One only has to make a cursory review of clinical literature to realize that nearly all clinical publications reference some sort of statistical test; be it t-test, chi-squared test, or F-test. In this paper, we describe an architecture for providing the Insight Toolkit with access to probability distributions. The architecture can support parametric and nonparametric probability distributions. Each distribution provides access to its probability density function (PDF), cumulative distribution function (CDF), inverse cumulative distribution function (inverse CDF), mean, and variance. These methods form the basis of statistical tests.",

   "abstract": "Various metrics have been proposed in the literature for performing intrinsic automatic image to image registration. Among these measures, mutual information is a very popular one because of its robustness and accuracy for a wide variety of applications. In this paper, we propose a filter for performing non-rigid registration by estimating a dense deformation field derived from the mutual information metric. This filter takes place in the ITK PDE deformable registration design like the Demons algorithm of Thirion. We also show how the concept of metric flow is conceptually linked to the concept of metric derivative for a prior transformation model by the transformation jacobian. We also suggest a sparse implementation of the GetJacobian() method for reducing the computation time of a metric derivative for local transformations models.",

The reduction in computation time comes at the cost of an additional storage of a parameters array. For both metric we have\r\nimplemented the option to use only a random subset of the fixed image voxels for calculating the metric value and its derivatives. This reduces the computation time (substantially), while convergence\r\nproperties are maintained. This paper is accompanied with the source code.",

We have tested this algorithm for 2D and 3D medical datasets, and the results are excellent in terms of accuracy and performance. One of the strongest points of the algorithms described here is that they can be used for many other applications, because they are based on the ordered propagation paradigm. This idea consists in actually not raster scan the image but rather in start from the image objects and propagate them until the image is totally filled. This has been demonstrated to be a good approach in many algorithms as for example, computation of Distance Transforms, Voronoi Diagrams, Fast Marching, skeletons computation, etc. We show here that these algorithms have low computational complexity and it provides excellent results for clinical applications as the segmentation of brain MRI.",

Both user processing functions and image read/write facilities are separately compiled as DLLs, and the resulting plugin objects are dynamically imported into the kernel. The library provides all the required wrapping material to incorporate all find of image processing functions into user-written components. A rapid prototyping application is provided to communicate with the kernel communication interface. No graphics programming skills is required to manage advanced user interactions, image display (e.g. OpenGL), and generic image processing functions based on C++ templates. The component-oriented software architecture makes it possible to share image processing and handling resources for light Windows processing applications.",

   "abstract": "Shape analysis has become of increasing interest to\nthe neuroimaging community due to its potential to precisely locate\nmorphological changes between healthy and pathological structures.\nThis manuscript presents a comprehensive set of tools for the computation of 3D structural statistical shape analysis. It has been applied in several studies on brain morphometry, but can potentially be employed in other 3D shape problems. Its main limitations is the necessity of spherical topology. \n\nThe input of the proposed shape analysis is a set of binary segmentation of a single brain structure, such as the hippocampus or caudate. These segmentations are converted into a corresponding spherical harmonic description (SPHARM), which is then sampled into a triangulated surfaces (SPHARM-PDM). After alignment, differences between groups of surfaces are computed using the Hotelling $T^2$ two sample metric. Statistical p-values, both raw and corrected for multiple comparisons, result in significance maps. Additional visualization of the group tests are provided via mean difference magnitude and vector maps, as well as maps of the group covariance information.\n\nThe correction for multiple comparisons is performed via two separate methods that each have a distinct view of the problem. The first one aims to control the family-wise error rate (FWER) or false-positives via the extrema histogram of non-parametric permutations. The second method controls the false discovery rate and results in a less conservative estimate of the false-negatives.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nitrc.org/projects/spharm-pdm\"> New NITRC page for binary distribution </a>\n ",

However, the currently available methods have been subject to a number of evaluations and criticism by important medical publications concerning both their low precision and their invasive procedures. Based on this scenario, the FootScanAge method was conceived, seeking to determine the GA through digital imaging of the newborn plantar surface. To support the evaluation and evolution of this new method, it was developed an Open Source and Java based Decision Support System that combines Data Mining and Image Processing techniques to implement the FootScanAge method. The system was developed taking advantage of high degree of interaction between experts in neonatology and computer science.",

   "abstract": "Image fusion provides a mechanism to combine multiple images into a single representation to aid human visual perception and image processing tasks. Such algorithms endeavour to create a fused image containing the salient information from each source image, without introducing artefacts or inconsistencies. Image fusion is applicable for numerous fields including: defence systems, remote sensing and geoscience, robotics and industrial engineering, and medical imaging. In the medical imaging domain, image fusion may aid diagnosis and surgical planning tasks requiring the segmentation, feature extraction, and/or visualisation of multi-modal datasets.\r\n\r\nThis paper discusses the implementation of an image fusion toolkit built upon the Insight Toolkit (ITK). Based on an existing architecture, the proposed framework (GIFT) offers a 'plug-and-play' environment for the construction of n-D multi-scale image fusion methods. We give a brief overview of the toolkit design and demonstrate how to construct image fusion algorithms from low-level components (such as multi-scale methods and feature generators). A number of worked examples for medical applications are presented in Appendix A, including quadrature mirror filter discrete wavelet transform (QMF DWT) image fusion.",

The target to pursue is a dark spot on colonoscopic images, called \u201cpattern\u201d. A novel methodology for \"pattern\" extraction and tracking was designed. Surgeons observations leads to the basic idea of this technique. Information about target position is then continues and makes possible prediction of the \u201cpattern\u201d position. A set of endoscopic images is tested to demonstrate the effectiveness of the vision technique. An experiment tool to simulate the endoscope navigation was employed to achieve real time performance.

   "abstract": "The Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC) is an NHLBI sponsored project which is studying histological, radiological, and clinical data on patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). At completion, over 1200 subjects will be enrolled. Each subject will have a minimum of one CT scan; however, many will likely have 3 CT scans. Each scan will have a corresponding radiological report, clinical report, and histological report. The NHLBI requires that the data collected through the LTRC be anonymized and available to independent researchers. The LTRC imaging database will be the most comprehensive database of lung CT data available to date and will serve as the basis for imaging studies of chronic lung disease for years to come. It is a significant opportunity for the medical image analysis community to investigate this database with the intent to develop new methods of registration, segmentation, and classification that may be used to diagnosis and treat patients with diffuse lung disease.",

   "abstract": "Statistical Shape Models are a popular method for segmenting three-dimensional medical images. To\r\nobtain the required landmark correspondences, various automatic approaches have been proposed. In\r\nthis work, we present an improved version of minimizing the description length (MDL) of the model. To\r\ninitialize the algorithm, we describe a method to distribute landmarks on the training shapes using a conformal\r\nparameterization function. Then, we introduce a novel procedure to modify landmark positions\r\nlocally without disturbing established correspondences. We employ a gradient descent optimization to\r\nminimize the MDL cost function, speeding up automatic model building by several orders of magnitude\r\nwhen compared to the original MDL approach. The necessary gradient information is estimated from\r\na singular value decomposition, a more accurate technique to calculate the PCA than the commonly\r\nused eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix. In this work, we first present a basic version where\r\nspatial locations are used in the MDL cost function; next, we introduce an extended version where any\r\ncombination of features can be used as a metric. As an example application, we present results based on\r\nlocal curvature measurements. Finally, we present results for synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrating\r\nthe efficiency of our procedures and give details about the implementation using the Insight\r\nToolkit (ITK).",

   "abstract": "As open source software projects gain acceptance in mission critical domains of a technology-enabled society, they must adapt their lightweight processes and tools to address the quality needs of these domains. One such domain is technology-supported surgical interventions. This paper presents an in-development toolset for validating the architecture of the open source Image-guided Surgical Toolkit (IGSTK). IGSTK components must conform to a specific architecture pattern based on state machines. Applications built on top of the IGSTK framework process and route instructions under specific constraints imposed by the architecture. This toolset focuses on validating that component state machines in IGSTK are designed and implemented in accordance with the architecture\u2019s constraints. These tools employ open source components as well, and apply theoretical concepts from computer science to a practical problem of guaranteeing safety in a mission critical domain.",

   "abstract": "This article presents an approach for decreasing the computational time for converting a sparse SpatialObject to an Image. The method is applicable for SpatialObjects which occupy less volume than the total output Image (which occurs often, especially when using TubeSpatialObjects to represent vessels). A new filter MaskedSpatialObjectToImageFilter is introduced which dramatically decreases the execution time by creating a mask of relevant pixels. The mask is computed by calling the conventional SpatialObjectToImageFilter at a lower resolution, which is significantly faster for large images. The mask is then up-sampled to control which areas are further processed.",

   "abstract": "VoxBo (www.voxbo.org) is a distributed processing framework, developed at the Center of Functional Neuroimaging at the University of Penssylvania, with the purpose of processing and analyzing brain functional MRI data. \r\nVoxBo is written in C++, and it is escentially a fair translation of some SPM functionality, originally written in Matlab. Along with the software, VoxBo defines two new image formats:\r\n1) .cub, a 3D image format, used for anatomical data and single EPI frames. It is important to notice that this format defines a proper origin field, lacking, for instance, in Analyze.\r\n2) .tes, a 4D image format, designed to contain the temporal EPI information. It is worth noticing that this format organizes the voxels in such a way to optimize longitudinal (temporal) voxel access.\r\nFurthermore, the tes format is compressed through encoding of the functional voxels alone, i.e., background voxels are not stored for each frame, but only for the first one.\r\n\r\nIn this work we present the necessary IO classes that allow ImageFileReader and ImageFileWriter to properly identify, read and write .cub files only. We will provide .tes support in a subsequent work.\r\nThis effort is carried out with the purpose of letting VoxBo implementors to take advantage of ITK's power and overcome the limitations currently afflicting VoxBo.",

   "abstract": "There is nowadays an increasing need in interaction between discrete surfaces (2-manifolds) and images. More specifically, segmentation and registration of n-dimensional images are taking advantage of a priori geometrical information, most often provided as discrete 2-manifolds.\r\nMost of the publicly available libraries are oriented either toward mesh processing or image processing.\r\nThrough a careful study we will show that none of those libraries are complete enough to fullfill image, surface and joint image-surface interaction.\r\nWe propose to implement in ITK library a powerful 2-manifold data structure. The choice of ITK was driven by the fact that it provides the best base framework along with a strong n-dimensional image kernel. Based on a Quad-Edge data structure, it has been specifically tailored not only to represent\r\norientable 2-manifolds (surfaces of real objects) but also ease further processing.\r\nWe illustrate the integration of the design into ITK as a native object, enhancing existing algorithms.\r\nWe also illustrate the power of the new design for further surface processing.",

We introduce a three-dimensional signed parallel implementation of the exact Euclidean distance transform algorithm developed by Maurer et al. with a theoretical complexity of O(n/p) for n voxels and p threads. Through this parallelization and efficient use of data structures we obtain approximately 3\r\ntimes mean speedup on standard tests on a 4-processor machine compared with the current ITK exact Euclidean distance transform filter.",

However, they can be very\r\ntime consuming, especially with 3D images, and with large structuring elements. Several algorithms\r\nhave been created to decrease the computation time, some of them with some limitations of shape of\r\nstructuring element. We have implemented several algorithms, studied their performance in different\r\nconditions, and shown that all of them are more efficients than the others in certain conditions.\r\n We finally introduce a new structuring element class and a some meta filter designed to select the best\r\nalgorithm depending on the image and the structuring element, and to smoothely integrate the different\r\nalgorithms available in the toolkit.",

   "abstract": "Phase Correlation Method (PCM or SPOMF - Symmetric Phase-Only Matched Filter) is a well known image registration method, that exploits Fourier Shift Theorem property of Fourier Transform. Even though it is limited to estimate only shifts between two images, it is very useful as it is robust to frequency-dependent noise and initial image overlap area. Furthermore, it evaluates very fast by way of two forward FFTs, one complex image division and one inverse FFT.",

   "abstract": "In an earlier submission, we considered 2-D and 3-D digital binary images topologically characterized by their well-composedness. Well-composed images exhibit important topological and geometrical properties not shared by their ill-composed counterparts. These properties have important implications for various algorithms used by the ITK community such as thinning algorithms and Marching Cubes. \r\n\r\nA natural follow-up inquiry to our original submission concerns the possible extension of the binary algorithm to accommodate images with multiple labels. In this paper, we describe such a generalization of our previous submission which also subsumes the binary approach. For completeness and clarity of exposition, we develop the idea of well-composedness within the binary image context and later generalize the discussion to include those images with multiple labels.",

   "abstract": "The subject of the paper is to introduce a new class of 4D filters to itk.While it is very easy to load a 3D volume stored as a series of DICOM images with ITK, some convenience functions that are already available for 3D volumes are not yet available for the 4D case. Especially for MR data (and to a certain limit also for CT data) it is very important to look at the full 4D series, since the radiologist usually does not make a diagnosis based on a single volume but on the full time series of volumes which shows the temporal flow of the contrast agent. As an example, for breast imaging the radiologist typically examines parameter maps like MIPt (maximum intensity over time), TTP (time to peak) or WI (Wash-In). These parameter maps are the 3D result of post-processing the entire 4D time series. The goal of proposing the denoted 4D filters is to provide ITK with functionality that enables a postprocessing job to handle the entire 4D series as one entity and not as a loose collection of 3D volumes.",

A specific implementation using a Kulback-Liebler type divergence function is provided to illustrate a possible extension of the base class along with test images to illustrate usage.

   "abstract": "Volumetric layers often encountered in medical image analysis are characterized by double and nested bounding surfaces. The thickness of a volumetric layer at a point on the bounding surface is the distance from that point to the opposite surface. There exist several definitions for the layer thickness. A newly proposed thickness definition is the radial thickness, which is defined as the distance between each pair of corresponding points on the two surfaces with the same polar coordinate. The thickness values calculated by the radial thickness definition are unique and does not depend on the starting surface. In this paper, we describe a class for calculating the radial thickness of one volumetric layer represented as coupled and nested triangle meshes. \r\n\r\nThe class, vtkRadialThicknessCalculate, is implemented using the Visualization Toolkit (VTK). In this document, we describe the radial thickness calculation algorithm and provide the user with the source code and the input data to reproduce the results. The radial thickness calculation described in this paper has a variety of applications including the thickness calculation for the skull vault, which is the original motivation for this work.",

   "abstract": "At the Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Engineering Research Center for Computer-Integrated Surgical Systems and Technology (ERC-CISST) laboratory, we have designed and developed a platformindependent C++ software package, called the nArray library, that provides a unified framework for efficiently working with multidimensional data sets. In this paper, we present and discuss the core elements of the library, including its intuitive and uniform API, efficient arithmetic engine algorithm, and efficient sub-volume algorithm. We then compare the performance of the nArray library with that of an existing multidimensional array toolkit, ITK. We conclude that the nArray library is more efficient than ITK in many situations, especially in operations on sub-arrays, and that the two packages have comparable performance in many other scenarios. The underlying algorithms, if incorporated in ITK, can help improve its performance.",

SharpImage is a stand-alone Windows application geared towards the pre-processing and creation of volume illustrations, although other generic tasks are inherently supported. The user interacts with the environment using a command console, and can view images as a series of slices or through volume rendering. We describe the design and introduce functionality using a number of examples. We have found the environment useful for prototyping a range of image processing tasks and provide the source-code in the hope others may also find it useful.",

   "abstract": "This paper presents an extension of the Visualization ToolKit dedicated to spatiotemporal data synchronization, visualization and management. It basically consists in a versatile library providing functionalities to help developers setting up sophisticated applications with minimal development effort. In the medical imaging context, various types of data are often encountered, which raises the need for adapted visualization and synchronization techniques. Moreover, the management of these data (organization, creation, deletion, access) can become a burden. We propose in vtkINRIA3D a strategy to synchronize interactions between datasets representations, to manipulate complex objects (e.g., neural fibers as obtained in DT-MRI), as well as a managing framework for organizing data (including temporal sequences). The efficiency of vtkINRIA3D is illustrated with two applications: MedINRIA (general medical image processing software) and CardioViz3D (cardiac image visualization). vtkINRIA3D is open-source, and comes with a set of examples, test data and softwares built upon it: http://www-sop.inria.fr/asclepios/software/vtkINRIA3D.",

   "abstract": "Performance validation of nonlinear registration algorithms is a difficult problem due to the lack of a suitable ground truth in most applications. However, the ill-posed nature of the nonlinear registration problem and the large space of possible solutions makes the quantitative evaluation of algorithms extremely\r\nimportant. We argue that finding a standardized way of performing evaluation and comparing existing and new algorithms currently is more important than inventing novel methods. While there are already existing evaluation frameworks for nonlinear inter-subject brain registration applications, there is still a lack of protocols for intra-subject studies or soft tissue organs. In this work we present\r\nsuch a framework which is designed in an \u201dopen-source\u201d and \u201dopen-data\u201d manner around the Insight Segmentation & Registration Toolkit. The goal of our work is to provide the research community with the basis framework that should be extended by interested people in a community effort to gain importance for evaluation studies. We demonstrate our proposed framework on a sample evaluation and release its implementation and associated tools to the public domain.",

While there has been progress in open image databases, the results of these efforts are under-reported. As such, imaging scientists are unaware of the available data. In addition, many researchers are interested in providing their data to the greater research community, but may be unaware of the process to release the data. The purpose of this paper is to describe our efforts in developing an open website which includes information on accessible medical image databases as well as some of the logistics for providing an open image database. Most importantly, the authors are requesting participation from the community to contribute to the Medical Image Database Repository (http://midr.org) in order to consolidate the collect knowledge of the community.",

   "abstract": "As part of the Center of Excellence in Genomic Science at Caltech, we have initiated the Digital Fish\r\nProject. Our goal is to use in toto imaging of developing transgenic zebrafish embryos on a genomic scale\r\nto acquire digital, quantitative, cell-based, molecular data suitable for modelling the biological circuits\r\nthat turn an egg into an embryo. In toto imaging uses confocal/2-photon microscopy to capture the\r\nentire volume of organs and eventually whole embryos at cellular resolution every few minutes in living\r\nspecimens thoughout their development. The embryos are labelled such that nuclei are one color and cell\r\nmembranes another color to allow cells to be segmented and tracked as they move and divide. The use\r\nof a transgenic marker in a third color allows a variety of molecular data to be marked. In toto imaging\r\ngenerates 4-d image sets (xyzt) which can contain 100,000 to 1,000,000 images per experiment. We are\r\ndeveloping a software package called GoFigure to visualize, segment, and analyze these very large image\r\nsets. GoFigure uses a MySQL database back end for managing storage of images and segmented objects\r\nand uses VTK and ITK for visualization and segmentation. We plan to use in toto imaging to digitize the\r\ncomplete expression and subcellular localization patterns of thousands of proteins throughout zebrafish\r\nembryogenesis. This genomic data, our zebrafish lines, and GoFigure will be distributed following the\r\nOpen Data/Open Source model.",

   "abstract": "We present an open-source ITK implementation of a direct Fourier method for tomographic reconstruction, applicable to parallel-beam x-ray images. Direct Fourier reconstruction makes use of the central-slice theorem to build a polar 2D Fourier space from the 1D transformed projections of the scanned object, that is resampled into a Cartesian grid. Inverse 2D Fourier transform eventually yields the reconstructed image. Additionally, we provide a complex wrapper to the BSplineInterpolateImageFunction to overcome ITK\u2019s current lack for image interpolators dealing with complex data types. A sample application is presented and extensively illustrated on the Shepp-Logan head phantom. We show that appropriate input zeropadding and 2D-DFT oversampling rates together with radial cubic b-spline interpolation improve 2D-DFT interpolation quality and are efficient remedies to reduce reconstruction artifacts.",

   "abstract": "The University of Iowa\u2019s Psychiatric Iowa Neuroimaging Consortium (PINC) has developed a program for mutual information registration of 3D brain imaging data using ITK classes, called BRAINSFit. We have written a helper class, itk::MultiModal3DMutualRegistrationHelper to simplify implementation and testing of different transform representations and optimizers. We have added a transform meeting the ITK standard, itk::ScaleVersor3DTransform. BRAINSFit is based on the registration examples from ITK, but adds new features, including the ability to employ different transform representations and optimization functions. \r\nOur goal was to determine best practices for registering 3D rigid multimodal MRI of the human brain. A version of the current program is employed here at PINC daily for automated processing of acquired brain images.\r\n\r\nThis project is managed on the NITRC site. http://www.nitrc.org/projects/multimodereg/\r\n\r\nOn the NITRC website, you can acquire the latest source code via SVN, or by downloading a compressed file which is generated every night. Binary versions are also available.\r\n",

Furthermore, general\r\ncode that uses the itk::OrientedImage will suffer an unnecessary penalty when the image is oriented\r\nparallel to the image axes.

   "abstract": "This presentation is a satire of the current obsession with intellectual property, innovation and originality that plagues the field of medical image analysis.\r\n\r\nThe presentation makes the point that most Journals and Conferences focus on Originality and despise Reproducibility and Verification, demonstrating great disrespect for the essential elements of the scientific method. The practice of \\\"peer-review\\\" is offered in most cases as an insufficient substitute for the actual verification of reproducibility.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, this presentation intends to brings awareness to the fact that authors of papers are treated by Publishers as if they were writers of Novels instead as reporters of scientific findings. In that confusion, authors are required to be \\\"original\\\" (as if they were writing Novels or Plays) instead of being required to report \\\"reproducible\\\" findings. Such practice obliterates critical thinking and erodes the basic principles of the scientific community.",

   "abstract": "Parameterization of surfaces, sometimes alled \u201d\u2018flattening\u201d\u2019 as it maps a surface embedded in 3D into its intrinsic 2D domain, is a powerfull tool for the analysis of surfaces. For the past years, there has been a growing interest in the Community that even lead to one implementation of one special type of parameterization in ITK [1,5,8,9]. We are providing here a more general framework for parameterization of single connected surfaces of any genus. It is based on a recent addition to ITK: itkQuadEdgeMesh [6] which allows an elegant an optimal implementation of algorithm for geometry and topology processing of discrete 2-manifolds. The 5 algorithms that we implemented map the meshes into a planar domain with fixed boundary leading to more stability and speed than mapping into the spherical domain. Each of them use different kind of parameterization with different properties. The conformal parameterization is usually used as it is intrinsic to the geometry of the mesh and thus allow shape analysis independently of the connectivity. However if flattening the mesh is your only goal, then the simplest parameterization algorithm (graph theory) will give you the best speed. This is the case when you want to further process the mesh in a lower dimension. Using specific solvers, the parameterization of meshes can be done sufficiently fast (couple of seconds) to consider this approach in interactive applications.",

   "abstract": "A novel platform for realizing software prototypes in the area of medical image processing, analysis and visualization is introduced: The \\\"Medical Image Processing Platform\\\" (MIPP). A novel feature is the combination of ITK/VTK with Java/Eclipse RCP, four potential technologies complementing each other. While ITK and VTK provide comprehensive functionality for image processing and visualization, Java and Eclipse RCP facilitate the development of a modern and rich application.\r\n\r\nRCP offers everything for creating plug-in based software. The benefits of integrating ITK and VTK in such a modular architecture are reusability and extensibility. Functionality usually found in software for medical image processing and visualization (2D and 3D viewers, DICOM and application data management, etc.) is provided by the MIPP platform as plug-ins, can be easily reused by new applications and needn\\'t be re-implemented. Developers can extend the platform\\'s features by contributing new plug-ins and, again, make these available for others.\r\n\r\nThe paper describes the architecture of the MIPP platform and outlines its most important functionality. Finally, three clinical software systems implemented with MIPP are presented.",

Its intuitive graphical user interface makes it easy to be used by physicians, radiologists, and research scientists. Several analysis and display tools are already available (navigator, zoom, pan, screen snapshot, ROI, and line measure tool; alpha-blending, checkerboard display, and split window display). Along with PET/CT, several other modalities where co-registered images are often visualized simultaneously have benefited from the use of this software.",

   "abstract": "ly in ITK, the only way to find the contour of the objects in a binary image is to use the BinaryErodeImageFilter, with a kernel of radius 1. This filter is a generic filter, made to support any shape and size of structuring element, and thus is not optimized for the particular case needed to detect the contours. Moreover, that filter is not multithreaded, so it can't get the performance improvements allowed by the multiprocessor systems. As a result, the contour detection can be quite time consuming currently -- for example, in SignedMaurerDistanceMapImageFilter, the contour detection takes about 33% of the execution time.\r\nThis contribution comes with a new filter which highly improve the performance of the contour detection in the binary image, and a second filter which allow the detection of the countours in label images with similar performance.",

We base this error estimation on a robust version of the HausdorffDistance\r\n(HD) metric applied to the recovered edges of the images. The robust modifications we introduce to\r\nthe HD metric significantly reduce the amount of outliers in the local distance error estimation. We\r\nevaluate the accuracy of our protocol on synthetically deformed images. We provide the source code\r\nand datasets to reproduce this evaluation. The proposed method is shown to improve error assessment\r\nwhen it is compared with conventional HD methods.

   "abstract": "Semi-automatic image segmentation algorithms depend on interaction with the user to accurately define a region of interest within an image. Once such method is a dynamic programming approach called {em Intelligent Scissors} developed by Mortenson and Barret cite{Mortensen1992,Mortensen1995,Barrett1996,Barrett1997}. Standard interaction involves the user-placement of a seed point on or near the boundary of the object to be extracted. Using a gradient-based cost function, a {em live-wire} image path from the seed point to a subsequently placed boundary point is determined. As this free point is manipulated with the mouse cursor, the live-wire boundary, which extends from the seed point to the varying free point, locks onto nearby edges within the image. Although some applications do not require such user-interaction (e.g. cite{Hu2001}) warranting inclusion within the toolkit, incorporating live-wire capabilities into ITK-SNAP cite{Yushkevich2006} has been discussed and, therefore, we would like to, as a preliminary step, vet the code within the ITK community.",

   "abstract": "When dealing with functional minimization, or maximization, it can sometimes be solved by a greedy algorithm. To implement greedy algorithm one needs priority queue container, i.e. get for a very low cost the lowest or highest element present in a sorted container. Whenever the priority of one element present in the queue needs to be modified, standard implementations, like \\code{std::priority\\_queue}, can not be applied directly. VTK has is own implementation \\code{vtkPriorityQueue} which is not templated and can only be applied for \\code{vtkIdType} and for the minimizing the functional. We propose here an implementation of a mutable priority queue container where element, priority, and objective (minimization or maximization) are given by template arguments. Our implementation allows to minimize or maximize a given functional, and any element can be modified, deleted at any time, and with a low cost.",

   "abstract": "noindent This document describes two new classes that facilitate the use of\r\nthe doxygen{BSplineDeformableTransform} in multiresolution registration\r\nalgorithms. The first class, doxygen{GridScheduleComputer}, defines the\r\nB-spline grid, based on a user-specified grid spacing and an input image (the\r\nfixed image in registration). A different grid is determined for each\r\nresolution level of the registration, given a multiresolution schedule similar\r\nto that of the image pyramids. The second class,\r\ndoxygen{UpsampleBSplineParametersFilter}, resamples (usually upsamples) the\r\nB-spline coefficients to a new control point grid having a different\r\nspacing/origin/size. This can be used to transfer the result from one\r\nresolution level to that of the next level. Summarising, suitable grid\r\ndefinitions follow from the first class, and are used as input for the second\r\nclass, which performs the actual resampling.\r\n\r\nThe classes are implemented using the Insight Toolkit url{www.itk.org}. This\r\npaper is accompanied with the source code, including a test program.",

   "abstract": "Although greyscale intensity values are primarily used in image data visualization oftentimes, due to the requirements of aesthetics (whether they be self-imposed or collaborator-suggested), mapping the greyscale image to a user-defined colormap is desired. In this paper, we propose a framework for inclusion in the ITK library for converting intensity-valued images to user-defined RGB colormap images. We also include several colormaps that can be readily applied for visualization of images in such programs as ITK-SNAP or can be used as examples for creating new colormaps.",

   "abstract": "Many image registration algorithms are formulated as optimization \r\nproblems with a gradient descent based solver, One difficulty with \r\ndesigning and implementing such methods is in the implementation of \r\nthe gradient computation. This process can be time-consuming and \r\nerror-prone. In addition some functions do not have gradients that can \r\nbe expressed in symbolic form. Automatic differentiation is useful for \r\ncomputing gradients of complicated objective functions. It moves the \r\nburden of computing gradients from the programmer to the computer. So \r\nfar, AD has not been exploited for use in image registration. This \r\npaper describes a software library the authors have developed to \r\nautomate the process of computing gradients of registration objective \r\nfunctions. This can alleviate the job of registration designers \r\nsomewhat and potentially make it easier to design better registration \r\nalgorithms.",

   "abstract": "When dealing with meshes, it is often preferable to work with a lower resolution mesh for computational\ntime purpose, display. The process of reducing a given mesh, mesh decimation, is thus an important step\nin most of pipeline dealing with meshes. Incremental decimation algorithms, the most popular ones,\nconsists of iteratively removing one point of the mesh, by Euler operations such as vertex removal or\nedge collapse. Here we focus on edge collapse based decimation approaches and propose a general\nframework based on a surface mesh data structure (itk::QuadEdgeMesh [3]). Our implementation intends\nto be as general and as flexible as possible. Indeed it can theoretically be applied on any polygonal\nmesh1; the measure, functional to be optimized at each iteration, the objective to be reached, and optional\nmethods like point relocation to enhance the geometry of the resulting mesh, are given by the user.\nWe provide here two specific implementations: itk::QuadEdgeMeshSquaredEdgeLengthDecimation\nand itk::QuadEdgeMeshQuadricDecimation, that could be used as example to implement additional\nalgorithms.",

   "abstract": "Computing local curvatures of a given surface is important for applications, shape analysis, surface segmentation, meshing, and surface evolution. For a given smooth surface (with a given analytical expression which is sufficiently differentiable) curvatures can be analytically and directly computed. However in real applications, one often deals with a surface mesh which is an insufficiently differentiable approximation, and thus curvatures must be estimated. Based on a surface mesh data structure (\\code{itk::QuadEdgeMesh}~\\cite{itkQE}), we introduce and implement curvature estimators following the approach of Meyer\\etal\\cite{Meyer02}. We show on a sphere that this method results in more stable curvature approximations than the commonly used discrete estimators (as used in VTK: \\code{vtkCurvatures}).",

   "abstract": "A novel point-set registration algorithm was proposed in [6] based on minimization of the Jensen-Shannon divergence. In this contribution, we generalize this Jensen-Shannon divergence point-set measure framework to the Jensen-Havrda-Charvat-Tsallis divergence. This generalization permits a \ufb01ne-tuning of the actual divergence measure between robustness and speci\ufb01city. The principle contribution of this submission is theitk::JensenHavrdaCharvatTsallisPointSetMetric class which is derived from the existing itk::PointSetToPointSetMetric. In addition, we provide other classes with utility that would extend beyond the point-set measure framework that we provide in this paper. This includes a point-set analogue of the itk::ImageFunction, i.e. itk::PointSetFunction. From this class we derive the class itk::ManifoldParzenWindowsPointSetFunction which provides a Parzen windowing scheme for learning the local structure of point-sets. Finally, we include the \r\nitk::DecomposeTensorFunction class which wraps the different vnl matrix decomposition schemes for easy use within ITK. \r\n",

In order to maintain the ITK library au courant, we developed a framework for graph-based methods of energy minimization in ITK which employ energy functions derived within a Markov Random Field (MRF) context. This required not only the implementation of the energy minimization methodology but also the more general requirement of introducing graph-related data structures into ITK which can be used for other graph-based algorithms pertinent to future extensions of the ITK library. \r\n\r\nPlease note that some of the algorithms described in this paper may be covered by patents and, as such, it is incumbent upon the user to seek licenses before building the binaries which utilize this code.

   "abstract": "In a surgical environment, there are many tools and objects (including the patient) being used. In a computer-aided surgery, the position of each of these tools in the operating room is very critical and generally will be tracked in their own coordinate systems. To show the surgeon a real time picture of the operating environment on a computer monitor, we need to know the position of each object with respect to one common coordinate system, which in turn can be achieved by knowing each coordinate system and the transforms between them. Image-Guided Surgical Toolkit is a software toolkit designed to enable biomedical researchers to rapidly prototype and create new applications for image-guided surgery. In IGSTK, in which the coordinate systems and the transforms are being successfully used, there is no central data structure or repository, which will hold all the coordinate systems and the transforms between them. Such a data structure could help the IGSTK software developers to have more confidence in the code they have written. This project develops a tool, which will create such a data structure and dynamically show the changes to it, to help such software developers to write better code.",

The resultant deformation \ufb01elds and metric values can be written to a \ufb01le. The program \r\nuses the Insight Toolkit (www.ITK.org) for all the computations, and can operate on any of the image \r\ntypes supported by that library.",

   "abstract": "Recently, an implementation of the Vessel Enhancing Diffusion (VED) algorithm [3] using the Insight Toolkit (ITK) framework [2] has been proposed by Enquobahrie et al.[1]. In this paper we present an alternative implementation, for two reasons. First, in this implementation all the main functionality of the algorithm, including eigensystem, vesselness, tensor calculation and PDE discretization using a forward Euler scheme are now grouped together in one single class. Although this may come at the cost of code-reusability, it improves readibility and enables application specific code optimization. The second reason is the criterion of reproducibility. Source code, test environment and example data of the paper [3] are provided.\n",

The method requires the user to provide two inputs: 1. path information in the form of start, end, and neighboring mode, the form of which path is allowed to propagate between neighboring pixels, and 2. a weighting function which sets the distance metric between neighboring pixels. A number of perspectives for choosing weighting functions are given, as well as examples using real images. This paper can also serve as an example for utilizing the Boost C++ graph library into the ITK framework.",

The \u201cradiotherapy structure set\u201d (RTSTRUCT) object of the DICOM standard is used for the transfer of patient structures and related data, between the devices found within and outside the radiotherapy department. It mainly contains the information of regions of interest (ROIs) and points of interest (E.g. dose reference points). In many cases, rather than manually drawing these ROIs on the CT images, one can indeed benefit from the automated segmentation algorithms already implemented in ITK. But at present, it is not possible to export the ROIs obtained from ITK to RTSTRUCT format. In order to bridge this gap, we have developed a framework for exporting contour data to RTSTRUCT. We provide here the complete implementation of RTSTRUCT exporter and present the details of the pipeline used. Results on a 3-D CT image of the Head and Neck (H&N) region are presented.",

   "abstract": "Our previous contributions to the ITK community include a generalized B-spline approximation scheme as well as a generalized information-theoretic measure for assessing point-set correspondence known as the Jensen-Havrda-Charvat-Tsallis (JHCT) divergence. In this submission, we combine these two contributions for the registration of labeled point-sets. The transformation model which uses the former contribution is denoted as directly manipulated free-form deformation (DMFFD) and has been used for image registration. The information-theoretic approach described not only eliminates exact cardinality constraints which plague exact landmark matching algorithms, but it also incorporates the local point-set structure into the similarity measure calculation. Although theoretical discussion of these two components is deferred to other venues, the implementation details given in this submission should be adequate for those wishing to use our algorithm. Visualization of results is aided by another of our previous contributions. Additionally, we provide the rudimentary command line parsing classes used in our testing routines which were written in the ITK style and also available to use consistent with the open-source paradigm.",

If not I suggest to have a look on the convolution filters and on the image reader.\r\n\r\nThe deformation field is updated and weighted thanks to the certainty matrix. The certainty matrix has no \\\"real interest\\\" by itself (according to the best of my knowledges). It is the respond, at a certain sampling, of the convolution of the image by the directional filters. The certainties are a linear transformation of the convoluted image.\r\n\r\nThe certainty matrix is the result of Pr. Andersson and Knutsson works from Linkoping University. I recommend the following papers\r\n- Non-rigid registration using morphons (at http://130.236.96.13/mi_old/Publications/pdfs/pettersson06.pdf#page=59 page 25 to 36)\r\n- Normalised convolution and morphons for non-rigid registration (at http://130.236.96.13/mi_old/Publications/pdfs/pkb06c.pdf )\r\n- Morphons: Paint on Priors and Elastic Canvas (http://130.236.96.13/mi_old/Publications/pdfs/ka05c.pdf)\r\nWell, also all the work of Knutsson. It mostly weights the deformation fields depending of the information on the image (a line or an edge has a higher certainty than a smooth area for example).\r\n\r\nI hope this helps.\r\n",

We use image \r\ngradients, distance maps, multiple channel information and a shape model to drive the evolution.

The \ufb01lters extract the cell foreground, construct the speed image, \ufb01nd seed points for \r\nevolution and collect cell statistics from the segmentation.

   "abstract": " Junctions of tubular structures (vasculature, trachea, neuron, etc) in medical images are critical for the topology of these structures. Identification of them is helpful in many applications. For example, quantification of geometric vascular features, registration of trachea movement due to respiration, tracing of neuron path. However, manual extraction of junctions can be tedious, time-consuming, and subject to operator bias. In this paper, we propose a novel method to detect them automatically and describe how to implement it in ITK framework. The input is a 2D/3D binary image that can be obtained from any segmentation techniques. The output will be positions of junctions and their sizes. There are only two parameters which need to be set by the user. We provide here the implementation as a ITK class: itk::JunctionDetectionFilter.\nPlease cite the following paper if you are interested in our work.\nG. Xiong, C. Chen, J. Chen, Y. Xie, and L.

   "abstract": "We propose a new nonlinear image registration model which is based on nonlinear elastic regularization and unbiased registration. The nonlinear elastic and the unbiased regularization terms are simplified using the change of variables by introducing an unknown that approximates the Jacobian matrix of the displacement field. This reduces the minimization to involve linear differential equations. In contrast to recently proposed unbiased fluid registration method, the new model is written in a unified variational form and is minimized using gradient descent. As a result, the new unbiased nonlinear elasticity model is computationally more efficient and easier to implement than the unbiased fluid registration. The unbiased large-deformation nonlinear elasticity method was tested using volumetric serial magnetic resonance images and shown to have some advantages for medical imaging applications.",

   "abstract": "Nonlinear finite element methods are described in which cyclic organ motion is implied from 4D scan data. The equations of motion corresponding to an explicit integration of the total Lagrangian formulation are reversed, such that the sequence of node forces which produces known changes in displacement is recovered. The forces are resolved from the global coordinate system into systems local to each element, and at every simulation time step are expressed as weighted sums of edge vectors. In the presence of large deformations and rotations, this facilitates the combination of external forces, such as tool-tissue interactions, and also positional constraints. Applications in the areas of surgery simulation and minimally invasive robotic interventions are discussed, and the methods are illustrated using CT images of a pneumatically-operated beating heart phantom.",

Mix-resolution Br-SDM consists of two separate Br-SDM of different resolutions: a high-resolution Br-SDM which is trained with more samples to capture the detail deforming variations in the main deforming regions of interest, together with a low-resolution Br-SDM which is trained with a smaller number of samples to capture the major variations of the remaining facial points. The experiments have shown that the mix-resolution Br-SDM is able to significantly reduce the predicting error compared with the corresponding Finite Element Model, while giving a low computational cost which is characteristic of the SDM approach.",

However, it is difficult to integrate large deformation and geometrical boundary conditions to the FE computations. In this paper, the force responses and surface deformation fields of the tissues against the indentation were measured by a force transducer and three-dimensional optical system. Large indentation experiments on porcine liver were performed to estimate the radius of influence from the indented point up to 8 mm indentation and to measure the force response for 7mm indentation. The radius of influence region was plotted against various indentation depths and indenter shapes, and it could be used to determine the model size for the characterization. The tissue behavior of large deformation considering influence of the boundary conditions was characterized with FE modeling via hyperelastic and linear viscoelastic model.",

In this paper, we focus on the design of orthopaedic implants that fit a maximum percentage of the target population, both in terms of geometry and biomechanical stability. CT scans of the bone under consideration are registered non-rigidly to obtain correspondences in position between them. A statistical model of shape is computed by means of principal component analysis. A method to automatically propagate standardize fractures on the statistically-based bone population has been developed as well as tools to optimize implant position to best-fit the bone surface. Afterwards, finite element analysis is performed to analyse the biomechanical performance of the bone/implant construct. The mechanical behaviour of different PCA bone instances is compared for tibia representing the Asian and Caucasian populations.",

   "abstract": "Primary stability of osseointegrated implants is necessary for short and long-term success of the treatment. This paper presents a method to help clinicians preoperatively assess this primary implant stability. The method combines a planning software with a in-house finite element solver. Once the clinician has chosen a position for the implant on the planning tool, a finite element analysis is automatically started and calculates the mechanical stability of the implant at this position. The process is designed to be as simple and fast as possible for an efficient clinical use. Mechanical testing material was used to validate the stability measured by the software. The novel tool presented here leads the way to a new generation of intelligent computer-assisted tools able to give a priori indication on the life span of the implant.",

   "abstract": "Meaningful physical models are important for studying cardiac physiology, such as quantitative assessments of pathology via changes in model parameters, and recovering information from medical images. In order to achieve realistic deformation studies, an anatomically accurate cardiac model under the prolate spheroidal coordinate system has been proposed, which comprises the pole-zero constitutive law characterized by 18 material parameters. Nevertheless, the large number of parameters and the complicated mathematics under the curvilinear coordinate system make it difficult to implement and computationally expensive. In consequence, we propose a cardiac model under the cartesian coordinate system comprising the Costa law, which is tailored for medical image analysis. The Costa law is characterized by a strain energy function with only seven material parameters, but has been reported as the best among the five tested well-known models in a comparative study, including the pole-zero law. In our framework, the penalty method for material incompressibility is used to avoid introduction of extra variables. Furthermore, we introduce a simple but novel boundary condition for enforcing cardiac specific boundary displacements under the cartesian coordinate system. With the active stresses provided by cardiac electromechanical models, and also the blood pressures acting as the natural boundary conditions on the endocardial surfaces, the physiologically plausible active deformation of the heart can be simulated. Experiments have been done on a cubical object to verify the correctness of the implementation, and also on a canine heart architecture to show the physiological plausibility of the cardiac model.",

   "abstract": "Heart illnesses influence the functioning of the cardiac muscle and are the major causes of death in\r\nthe world. Optic flow methods are essential tools to assess and quantify the contraction of the cardiac\r\nwalls, but are hampered by the aperture problem. Harmonic phase (HARP) techniques measure the\r\nphase in magnetic resonance (MR) tagged images. Due to the regular geometry, patterns generated by\r\na combination of HARPs and sine HARPs represent a suitable framework to extract landmark features.\r\nIn this paper we introduce a new aperture-problem free method to study the cardiac motion by tracking\r\nmulti-scale features such as maxima, minima, saddles and corners, on HARP and sine HARP tagged\r\nimages.",

   "abstract": "The assignment of bone material properties to finite element model is a fundamental step in finite element analysis and has great influence on analysis results. Most work done in this area has adopted isotropic assignment strategy as its simplicity. However, bone material is widely recognized as being anisotropic rather than isotropic. Therefore, this work is aimed to simulate the inhomogeneity and anisotropy of femur by assigning each element of the mesh model the material properties with a numerical integration method and properly defining the principal material orientation, and then compare the biomechanical analysis results of isotropic model with that of anisotropic model under six different loading conditions. Based on the analysis results of the equivalent Von Mises stress and the nodal displacement, four different regions of interest are chosen to achieve this comparison. The results show that significant differences between the two material property assignments exist in the regions where anisotropic material property is sensitive to orientation definition. Thus, orientation definition is important to finite element simulation of bone material properties.",

   "abstract": "We present a framework for cardiac motion recovery using the adjustment of an electromechanical model of the heart to cine Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI). This approach is based on a constrained minimisation of an energy coupling the model and the data. Our method can be seen as a data assimilation of a dynamic system that allows us to weight appropriately the confidence in the model and the confidence in the data. After a short overview of the electromechanical model of the ventricles, we describe the processing of cine MR images and the methodology for motion recovery. Then, we compare this method to the methodology used in data assimilation. Presented results on motion recovery from given cine-MRI are very promising. In particular, we show that our coupling approach allows us to recover some tangential component of the ventricles motion which cannot be obtained from classical geometrical tracking approaches due to the aperture problem.",

   "abstract": "Surgical repair of the mitral valve results in better\r\noutcomes than valve replacement, yet diseased valves\r\nare often replaced due to the technical difficulty of the\r\nrepair process. A surgical planning system based on\r\npatient-specific medical images that allows surgeons to\r\nsimulate and compare potential repair strategies could\r\ngreatly improve surgical outcomes. The system must\r\nsimulate valve closure quickly and handle the complex\r\nboundary conditions imposed by the chords that tether\r\nthe valve leaflets. We have developed a process for\r\ngenerating a triangulated mesh of the valve surface\r\nfrom volumetric image data of the opened valve. The\r\nclosed position of the mesh is then computed using a\r\nmass-spring model of dynamics. In the mass-spring\r\nmodel, triangle sides are treated as linear springs\r\nsupporting only tension. Chords are also treated as\r\nlinear springs, and self-collisions are detected and\r\nhandled inelastically. The equations of motion are\r\nsolved using implicit numerical integration. The\r\nsimulated closed state is compared with an image of the\r\nsame valve taken in the closed state to assess accuracy\r\nof the model. The model exhibits rapid valve closure\r\nand is able to predict the closed state of the valve with\r\nreasonable accuracy.",

   "abstract": "The elastic registration of medical scans from different acquisition sequences is becoming an important topic for many research labs that would like to continue the post-processing of medical scans acquired via the new generation of high-field-strength scanners. In this note, we present a parameter-free registration algorithm that is well suited for this scenario as it requires no tuning to specific acquisition sequences. The algorithm encompasses a new numerical scheme for computing elastic registration maps based on the minimizing flow approach to optimal mass transport. The approach utilizes all of the gray-scale data in both images, and the optimal mapping from image A to image B is the inverse of the optimal mapping from B to A. Further, no landmarks need to be specified, and the minimizer of the distance functional involved is unique. We apply the algorithm to register the white matter folds of two different scans and use the results to parcellate the cortex of the target image. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the optimal mass transport function has been applied to register large 3D multimodal data sets.",

   "abstract": "Very little is known about the deformation effects of tumour growth within the brain. Computer simulations have the potential to\r\ncalculate such deformations. A method for computing localised high deformations within the brain's soft tissue is presented. Such\r\nknowledge would be significant towards neuroscience and neurosurgery, particularly for quantifying tumour aggressiveness,\r\ntherapy planning, as well as surgical planning and simulation. A Finite Element mesh used in the vicinity of a growing tumour is\r\nvery quickly destroyed and cannot be used reliably unless complicated automatic re-meshing exists. Mesh-free methods are\r\ncapable of handling much larger deformations, however are known to be less reliable that Finite Element analysis for moderate\r\ndeformations. A mixed-mesh approach utilises mesh-free regions within localised high-deformation zones, with the remaining\r\nmodel comprised of a Finite Element mesh. In this study, a new algorithm is proposed coupling the Finite Element and Element\r\nFree Galerkin methods for use in applications of high localised deformation, such as brain tumour growth. The algorithm is\r\nverified against a number of separate Finite Element and mesh-free problems solved via validated/commercial software.\r\nMaximum errors of less than 0.85 mm were maintained, corresponding to the working resolution of an MRI scan. A mixed-mesh\r\nbrain model is analysed with respect to different tumour growth volumes located behind the left ventricle. Significant\r\ndisplacements of up to 9.66 mm surrounding a 4118 mm3 sized tumour are noted, with 14.5% of the brain mesh suffering\r\ndeformation greater than 5 mm.",

   "abstract": "A large number of pathological conditions result in significant changes of the mechanical properties of the aortic wall. Using the Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) as an indicator of aortic stiffness has been proposed for several decades. Pulse Wave Imaging (PWI) is an ultrasonography-based imaging method that has been developed to map and quantify the pulse wave (PW) propagation along the abdominal aortic wall and measure its local properties. We present a finite-element-based approach that aims at improving our understanding of the complex PW patterns observed by PWI and their relationship to the underlying mechanical properties. A Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) coupled model was developed based on an idealized axisymmetric aorta geometry. The accuracy of the model as well as its ability to reproduce realistic PW propagation were evaluated by performing a parametric analysis on aortic elasticity, by varying the aortic Young\ufffds modulus between 20 kPa and 2000 kPa. The Finite-Element model was able to predict with good accuracy the expected PWV values in different theoretical cases, with an averaged relative difference of 14% in the 20kPa-100kPa, which corresponds to a wide physiologic range for stiffness of the healthy aorta. This study allows to validate the proposed FE model as a tool that is capable of representing quantitatively the pulse wave patterns in the aorta.",

   "abstract": "This coronary-artery extraction method uses one initialization point per vessel. First, a mask is computed by use of a region-growing algorithm, which starts from the initial point and stops when no more connected voxels fall within an interactively defined intensity range. The centerline tracking is then\nperformed within the mask, starting from the same initial point. This algorithm is based on a prediction/estimation scheme. It uses the first- and second-order image moments calculated within a spherical volume that slides along the vessel, and the radius of which is automatically adjusted to the local radius\nof the vessel. The evolution of the radius of the sphere is based on the analysis of the eigenvalues of the inertia matrix in a multi-scale framework. The estimation of the current point location makes use\nof an elastic model similar to \u201dsnakes\u201d. The point iteratively moves under the action of an image-force attracting it to the local gravity center, and under the reaction of the internal forces of the model, which\nreflect its shape constraints: continuity and smoothness. The prediction makes use of the eigenvectors of\nthe inertia matrix. The stopping criteria of the centerline tracking are based on the size of the sphere and on the percentage of the masked voxels within the sphere.\nOn 8 training CT datasets, the following mean results were obtained. Overlap with reference: considering the whole length (OV) 80.1%, until the first failure (OF) 48.9%, in clinically relevant segments (radius > 1.5 mm, OT) 81.7%. Average distance from reference: considering the whole length\n(AD) 4.32 mm, limited to segments where the semiautomatic centerline remains within the vessel (AI) 0.39 mm, in clinically relevant segments (AT) 4.13 mm. On 16 testing datasets, these results were respectively: OV =80.2%, OF =39.3%, OT =82.1%, AD =5.05 mm, AI =0.41 mm and AT =4.58 mm. \nA number of failures was due to the the fact that the model does not handle the bifurcations.",

   "abstract": "The extraction of the coronary artery central lumen lines from CTA datasets is a necessary prerequisite for the computerized assessment of heart related disease. In this work, we present an automatic approach for this task that consists of generic methods for detection of tubular objects, extraction of their centerlines, grouping of the single centerlines into complete tree structures, and some application specific adaptions for the identification of the coronary arteries. The tube detection approach is based on the Gradient Vector Flow and an analysis of the resulting vector field. Contrary to conventional tube detection filters this approach avoids multi-scale analysis with related scale space problems and is able to identify tubular objects surrounded by different tissues such as blood vessels in proximity of calcifications. After identification of the tubular structures their centerlines are extracted and grouped into complete tree structures. Based on gray value information and centerline length tubular structures not belonging to the coronary arteries are removed. The approach has been evaluated on 16 clinical datasets showing a high overlap of 94% with known reference centerlines and an average distance of 0.58mm.",

   "abstract": "We present a new method for the simultaneous, nearly automatic segmentation of liver contours, vessels,\r\nand tumors from abdominal CTA scans. The method repeatedly applies multi-resolution, multi-class\r\nsmoothed Bayesian classification followed by morphological adjustment and active contours refinement.\r\nIt uses multi-class and voxel neighborhood information to compute an accurate intensity distribution\r\nfunction for each class. Only one user-defined voxel seed for the liver and additional seeds according\r\nto the number of tumors inside the liver are required for initialization. The algorithm do not require\r\nmanual adjustment of internal parameters. In this work, a retrospective study on a validated clinical\r\ndataset totaling 20 tumors from 9 patients CTAs\ufffd was performed. An aggregated competition score of\r\n61 was obtained on the test set of this database. In addition we measured the robustness of our algorithm\r\nto different seeds initializations. These results suggest that our method is clinically applicable, accurate,\r\nefficient, and robust to seed selection compared to manually generated ground truth segmentation and to\r\nother semi-automatic segmentation methods.",

   "abstract": "Automatic tracking of coronary arteries in Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) is a challenging task. To accomplish it we propose a method consisting of two main steps: (1) A 3D model of the heart is matched for detecting the approximate position of the heart. Based on this information candidates for origins of coronary arteries are calculated. (2) Fitting of cylindrical sampling patterns is performed for extracting the vessel tree of coronary arteries. Branching and termination are handled by depth-first search and noise level estimation respectively. Results show that -- compared to human intra-observer variations -- the presented method performs worse for accuracy measures (on average 39.4 scores), but slightly better for overlap measures (on average 51.5 scores).",

   "abstract": "Liver tumour segmentation from computed tomography (CT) scans is a challenging task. A semi-automatic method based on 2D region growing with knowledge-based constraints is proposed to segment lesions from constituent 2D slices obtained from 3D CT images. Minimal user involvement is required to define an approximate region of interest around the suspected legion area. The seed point and feature vectors are then calculated and voxels are labeled using a region-growing approach. Knowledge-based constraints are incorporated into the method to ensure the size and shape of the segmented region is within acceptable parameters. The individual segmented lesions can then be stacked together to generate a 3D volume. The proposed method was tested on a training set of 10 tumours and a testing set of 10 tumours. To evaluate the results quantitatively, various measures were used to generate scores. Based on the results obtained from the 10 testing tumours, the method was resulted in an average score of 64.",

Then the extracted tumor contour, after some morphological operations, was projected to its neighboring slices for automated sampling, learning and further voxel classification in neighboring slices. This propagation procedure continued till all tumor-containing slices were processed.

   "abstract": "Automatic segmentation of liver tumorous regions often fails due to high noise and large variance of tumors. In this work, a semi-automatic algorithm is proposed to segment liver tumors from computed tomography (CT) images. To cope with the variance of tumors, their intensity probability density functions (PDF) are modeled as a bag of Gaussians unlike the previous works where the tumor is modeled as a single Gaussian, and employ a three-dimensional seeded region growing (SRG) method. The bag of Gaussians are initialized at manually selected seeds and updated during growing process iteratively. There are two criteria to be ful&#64257;lled for growing: one is the Bayesian decision rule, and the other is a model matching measure. Once the growing is terminated, morphological operations are performed to re&#64257;ne the result. This method, showing promising performance, has been evaluated using ten CT scans of livers with twenty tumors provided by the organizer of the 3D Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge 2008.",

This paper presents a semi-automatic algorithm (one input point per vessel) based on morphological grayscale local reconstructions in 3D images devoted to the extraction of the coronary artery tree. The algorithm has been evaluated in the framework of the Coronary Artery Tracking Challenge 2008 [1], obtaining consistent results in overlapping measurements (a mean of 70% of the vessel well tracked). Poor results in accuracy measurements suggest that future work should refine the centerline extraction. The algorithm can be efficiently implemented and its general strategy can be easily extrapolated to a completely automated centerline extraction or to a user interactive vessel extraction.",

   "abstract": "In CT images, tumors located in a liver are generally identified by intensity difference between tumor and liver. The intensity of the tumor can be lower and or higher than that of the liver. However, the main problem of liver tumor detection from is related to low contrast between tumor and liver intensities. Tumor sometimes presents in a very small dimension and makes the detection even more difficult. In this work, we focus on contrast enhancement of CT images containing liver and tumor based on the histogram processing as a necessary preprocessing for liver tumor identification. Results show that using our proposed method, the contrast of the CT images can be enhanced and results in relatively accurate identification of tumors in the liver.",

This strategy leads\r\nto an interactive method that we use to delineate tumors in 3D CT\r\nimages. We detail our strategy to achieve relevant segmentations of\r\nthese structures and compare our results to hand made segmentations\r\ndone by experienced radiologists. This paper summarizes our\r\nparticipation to the MICCAI 2008 workshop called: \"3D segmentation in the clinic : A\r\nGrand Challenge II\".",

   "abstract": "This paper describes an ensemble segmentation trained by the AdaBoost algorithm, which finds a sequence of weak hypotheses, each of which is appropriate for the distribution on training example, and combines the weak hypotheses by a weighted majority vote. In our study, a weak hypothesis corresponds to a weak segmentation process. This paper shows a procedure for generating an ensemble segmentation algorithm using AdaBoost, and applies it to a liver lesion extraction problem from a contrast enhanced abdominal CT volume. A leave-one-patient-out validation test using 16 CT volumes demonstrated the effectiveness of the generated ensemble segmentation algorithm. In addition, we evaluated the performance by applying the algorithm to unknown test data provided by the \ufffd3D Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge 2008\ufffd.",

   "abstract": "A method for automatic liver tumor segmentation from computer tomography (CT) images is presented in this paper. Segmentation is an important operation before surgery planning, and automatic methods offer an alternative to laborious manual segmentation. In addition, segmentations of automatic methods are reproducible, so they can be reliably evaluated and they do not depend on the performer of the segmentation. In this work, the segmentation is performed in two stages. First a rough segmentation of tumors is obtained by simple thresholding and morphological operations. \r\nThe second stage refines the rough segmentation result using fuzzy clustering and a geometric deformable model (GDM) that is fitted on the clustering result. \r\nThe method was evaluated with data provided by Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge 08, to which the method also participated. The data included 10 \r\nimages from which 20 tumors were segmented. The method showed promising results.",

Twenty datasets from MS patients with FLAIR, T1,T2, MD and FA data with expert annotations are available as training set from the MICCAI 2008 challenge on MS, and 24 test datasets. Our local feature vector method contains neighbourhood voxel intensities, histogram and MS probability atlas information. Principal Component Analysis(PCA) \\cite{PCA} with log-likelihood ratio is used to classify each voxel. MRI suffers from intensity inhomogenities. We try to correct this ''bias field'' with 3 methods: a genetic algorithm, edge preserving filtering and atlas based correction. A large observer variability exist between expert classifications, but the similarity scores between model and expert classifications are often lower. Our model gives the best classification results with raw data, because bias correction gives artifacts at the edges and flatten large MS lesions.",

   "abstract": "This paper proposes a new method for fully automated multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation in cranial magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The algorithm uses the T1-weighted and the fluid attenuation inversion recovery scans. It is based the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classification technique. The data has been acquired at the Children\ufffds Hospital Boston (CHB) and the University of North Carolina (UNC). Manual segmentations, composed by a human expert of the CHB, were used for training of the KNN-classification. The method uses voxel location and signal intensity information for determination of the probability being a lesion per voxel, thus generating probabilistic segmentation images. By applying a threshold on the probabilistic images binary segmentations are derived. Automatic segmentations were performed on a set of testing images, and compared with manual segmentations from a CHB and a UNC expert rater. Furthermore, a combined segmentation was composed from segmentations from different algorithms, and used for evaluation. The proposed method shows good resemblance with the segmentations of the CHB rater. High specificity and lower specificity has been observed in comparison with the combined segmentations. Over- and undersegmentation can be easily corrected in this procedure by varying the threshold on the probabilistic segmentation image. The proposed method offers an automated and fully reproducible approach that accurate and applicable on standard clinical MR images.",

   "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis diagnosis and patient follow-up can be helped by an evaluation of the lesion load in MRI sequences. A lot of automatic methods to segment these lesions are available in the literature. The MICCAI workshop Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation Challenge 08 allows to test and compare these algorithms. This paper presents a method designed to detect hyperintense signal area on T2-FLAIR sequence and its results on the Challenge test data. The proposed algorithm uses only three conventional MRI sequences: T1, T2 and T2-FLAIR. First, images are cropped, spatially unbiased and skull-stripped. A segmentation of the brain into its different compartments is performed on the T1 and the T2 sequences. From these segmentations, a threshold for the T2-FLAIR sequence is automatically computed. Then postprocessing operations select the most plausible lesions in the obtained hyperintense signals. Global result on the test data (80/100) is close to the inter-expert variability (90/100).",

   "abstract": "At the German Heart Center Munich we have installed and evaluated a novel system for robotic surgery. Its main features are the\r\nincorporation of haptics (by means of strain gauge sensors at the instruments) and partial automation of surgical tasks. However,\r\nin this paper we focus on the software engineering aspects of the system. We present a hierarchical approach, which is inspired by the\r\nmodular architecture of the hardware. Each component of the system, and therefore each component of the control software can be\r\neasily interchanged by another instance (e.g. different types of robots may be employed to carry the surgical instruments). All\r\noperations are abstracted by an intuitive user interface, which provides a high level of transparency. In addition, we have included\r\ntechniques known from character animation (so called key-framing) in order to enable operation of the system by users with non-engineering\r\nbackgrounds. The introduced concepts have proven effective during an extensive evaluation with 30 surgeons. Thereby, the system was\r\nused to conduct simplified operations in the field of heart surgery, including the replacement of a papillary tendon and the occlusion\r\nof an atrial septal defect.",

   "abstract": "Ultrasound has become a very important modality in image-guided therapy. At present, however, the collection, synchronization and transfer of ultrasonic images are more cumbersome than necessary. This paper presents a reusable solution to these problems. We propose a software package called SynchroGrab, which allows the collection of interventional ultrasound images as well as their synchronization with a stream of pose measurements. The software includes support for an open-interface ultrasound system, namely the Sonix RP, from Ultrasonix (Vancouver, Canada). Using an open-interface system like the Sonix RP allows customization of the imaging process and the capture of the ultrasound images directly from memory without the need for a frame-grabbing card. Pose measurement is currently performed with an Optotrak Certus by Northern Digital (Waterloo, Canada). However, extensibility was a primary goal in the design of this software, so the support of new devices can be achieved simply by sub-classing the relevant base class. SynchroGrab also performs reconstruction of 3D ultrasound volumes from synchronized data streams. Moreover, the recorded images, volumes and tracking information are available for visualization or further processing either directly from the file system or from a network connection compliant with the OpenIGTLink protocol, which is supported by Slicer 3.",

   "abstract": "This document describes a novel scheme for the automated extraction of the central lumen lines of\r\ncoronary arteries from computed tomography angiography (CTA) data. The scheme \ufb01rst obtains a seg-\r\nmentation of the whole coronary tree and subsequently extracts the centerlines from this segmentation.\r\nThe \ufb01rst steps of the segmentation algorithm consist of the detection of the aorta and the entire heart\r\nregion. Next, candidate coronary artery components are detected in the heart region after the masking of\r\nthe cardiac blood pools. Based on their location and geometrical properties the structures representing\r\nthe right and left arterties are selected from the candidate list. Starting from the aorta, connections\r\nbetween these structures are made resulting in a \ufb01nal segmentation of the whole coronary artery tree, A\r\nfast-marching level set method combined with a backtracking algorithm is employed to obtain the initial\r\ncenterlines within this segmentation. For all vessels a curved multiplanar reformatted image (CMPR) is\r\nconstructed and used to detect the lumen contours. The \ufb01nal centerline was then de\ufb01ned by determining\r\nthe center of gravity of the detected lumen in the transversal CMPR slices.\r\nWithin the scope of the MICCAI Challenge \"Coronary Artery Tracking 2008\", the coronary tree\r\nsegmentation and centerline extraction scheme was used to automatically detect a set of centerlines in\r\n24 datasets. For 8 data sets reference centerlines were available. This training data was used during\r\nthe development and tuning of the algorithm. Sixteen other data sets were provided as testing data.\r\nEvaluation of the proposed methodology was performed through submission of the resulting centerlines\r\nto the MICCAI Challenge website",

   "abstract": "We have created open-source Simulink block libraries for ITK and VTK that allow pipelines for these toolkits to be built in a visual, drag-and-drop style within MATLAB. Each block contains an instance of an ITK or VTK class. Any block connections and parameters that the user makes within MATLAB's Simulink visual environment are converted into connections and parameters for the ITK and VTK pipelines. In addition, we provide conversion of images to and from MATLAB arrays to allow MATLAB image processing blocks to be mixed with ITK and VTK blocks. The code for our block libraries is generated automatically from XML descriptions of the inputs, outputs, and parameters of the ITK and VTK classes. We have used these block libraries to build some example pipelines and believe that they will be useful for developing applications in image analysis and image-guided therapy.",

   "abstract": "The finite element (FE) method is a powerful tool for the study of biomechanics. One of the limiting factors in transitioning this tool into the clinic is the time required to generate high quality meshes for analysis. Previously, we developed a mapped meshing technique that utilized force control and a finite element solver to warp a template mesh onto subject specific surfaces. This paper describes a displacement based method that directly warps the template mesh onto subject specific surfaces using distance as the driving measure for the deformable registration. The resulting meshes were evaluated for mesh quality and compared to the force based method. An initial evaluation was performed using a mathematical phantom. The algorithm was then applied to generate meshes for the phalanx bones of the human hand. The algorithm successfully mapped the template bone to all of the bony surfaces, with the exception of the distal phalanx bone. In this one case, significant differences existed between the geometries of the template mesh and the distal phalanx. Further refinement of the algorithm may allow the algorithm to successfully generate meshes even in the presence of large geometric shape differences.",

   "abstract": "A novel partnership between surgeons and machines, made possible by advances in computing and engineering technology, could overcome many of the limitations of traditional surgery. By extending surgeons' ability to plan and carry out surgical interventions more accurately and with less trauma, Computer-Integrated Surgery (CIS) systems could help to improve clinical outcomes and the efficiency of health care delivery. CIS systems could have a similar impact on surgery to that long since realized in Computer-Integrated Manufacturing (CIM). Mathematical modeling and computer simulation have proved tremendously successful in engineering. Computational mechanics has enabled technological developments in virtually every area of our lives. One of the greatest challenges for mechanists is to extend the success of computational mechanics to fields outside traditional engineering, in particular to biology, the biomedical sciences, and medicine. \r\n\r\nComputational Biomechanics for Medicine Workshop series was established in 2006 with the first meeting held in Copenhagen. The third workshop was held in conjunction with the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention Conference (MICCAI 2008) in New York on 10 September 2008. It provided an opportunity for specialists in computational sciences to present and exchange opinions on the possibilities of applying their techniques to computer-integrated medicine. \r\n\r\nComputational Biomechanics for Medicine III was organized into two streams: Computational Biomechanics of Soft Tissues, and Computational Biomechanics of Tissues of Musculoskeletal System. The application of advanced computational methods to the following areas was discussed:\r\n- Medical image analysis; \r\n- Image-guided surgery; \r\n- Surgical simulation; \r\n- Surgical intervention planning; \r\n- Disease prognosis and diagnosis; \r\n- Injury mechanism analysis; \r\n- Implant and prostheses design; \r\n- Medical robotics. \r\n\r\nAfter rigorous review of full (eight-to-twelve page) manuscripts we accepted 15 papers, collected in this volume. They were split equally between podium and poster presentations. The proceedings also include abstracts of two invited lectures by world-leading researchers Professor Chwee Teck Lim from national University of Singapore and Dr. David Lloyd from The University of Western Australia.\r\n\r\nInformation about Computational Biomechanics for Medicine Workshops, including Proceedings of previous meetings is available at http://cbm.mech.uwa.edu.au/ .\r\n\r\nWe would like to thank the MICCAI 2008 organizers for help with administering the Workshop, invited lecturers for deep insights into their research fields, the authors for submitting high quality work, and the reviewers for helping with paper selection.",

   "abstract": "The task of classifying or labeling cortical sulci is made difficult by the fact that individual sulci may not have unique distinguishing features and usually need to be identified by a multivariate feature set that takes the relative spatial arrangement into account. In this paper, classical multidimensional scaling (MDS), which gives a geometric interpretation to input dissimilarity data, is used to classify 180 sulci drawn from the ten major classes of sulci. Using a leave-one-out validation strategy, we acheive a success rate of 100% in the best case and 78% in the worst case. For these more difficult cases, we propose a second stage of classification using shape based features. One of these features is the geodesic distance between sulcal curves obtained from a new open curve representation in a geometric framework.\r\nWith MDS, we o\ufb00er a simple and intuitive approach to a challenging problem. Not only can we easily separate left and right brain sulci, but we also narrow the classification problem from, in this case, a 10-class to a 2-class problem. More generally, we can identify a region-of-interest (ROI) within which one can carry out further classification.",

   "abstract": "Abstract. Statistical shape models (SSM) capture the variation of shape across a population, in order to allow further analysis. Previous work demonstrates that deformation fields contain global transformation components, even if global pre-\r\nregistration is performed. It is crucial to construction of SSMs to remove these global transformation components from the local deformations - thus obtaining minimal deformations - prior to using these as input for SSM construction. In medical image processing, parameterized SSMs based on control points of free-form deformations (FFD) are a popular choice, since they offer several advantages compared to SSMs based on dense deformation \ufb01elds. In this work, we extend the previous approach by presenting a framework for construction of both, unparameterized and FFD-based SSMs from minimal deformations. The core of the method is computation of minimal deformations by extraction of the linear part from the original dense deformations. For FFD-based SSMs, the FFD-parameterization of the minimal deformations is performed by projection onto the space of FFDs. Both steps are computed by close-form solutions optimally in the least-square sense. The proposed method is evaluated on a data set of 62 MR images of the corpus callosum. The results show a significant improvement achieved by the proposed method for SSMs built on dense \ufb01elds, as well as on FFD-based SSMs.",

   "abstract": "The \ufb01eld of computational anatomy has developed rigorous frameworks for analyzing anatomical shape, based on diffeomorphic transformations of a template. However, differences in algorithms used for template warping, in regularization parameters, and in the template itself, lead to different representations of the same anatomy. Variations of these parameters are considered as confounding factors. Recently, extensions of the conventional computational anatomy framework to account for such confounding variations has shown that learning the equivalence class derived from the multitude of representations can lead to improved and more stable morphological descriptors. Herein, we follow that approach, estimating the morphological appearance manifold obtained by varying parameters of the template warping procedure. Our approach parallels work in the computer vision \ufb01eld, in which variations lighting, pose and other parameters leads to image appearance manifolds representing the exact same \ufb01gure in different ways. The proposed framework is then used for groupwise registration and statistical analysis of biomedical images, by employing a minimum variance criterion to perform manifold-constrained optimization, i.e. to traverse each individual\u2019s morphological appearance manifold until all individuals' representations come as close to each other as possible. E\ufb00ectively,\r\nthis process removes the aforementioned confounding e\ufb00ects and potentially leads to morphological representations re\ufb02ecting purely biological variations, instead of variations introduced by modeling assumptions and parameter settings. The nonlinearity of a morphological appearance manifold is treated via local approximations of the manifold via PCA.",

   "abstract": "In this work a minimum cost path approach is adopted to extract coronary artery centerlines from CTA data. The algorithm depends on the manual definition of the start and end point of the vessel. The cost image used in the minimal cost path approach is based on a vesselness measure and a smooth window function on intensity. In the majority of the cases the method was able to extract the centerlines successfully (overlap > 90%). Accuracy of the method is around two times the voxelsize of the datasets. To conclude, minimum cost path approaches have potential for coronary artery centerline extraction, but improvements, especially regarding the accuracy of the method, still need investigations.",

   "abstract": "Several algorithms exist for correcting the nonuniform intensity in magnetic resonance images caused by field inhomogeneities. These algorithms constitute important preprocessing steps for subsequent image analysis tasks. One such algorithm, known as parametric bias field correction (PABIC), has already been implemented in ITK. Another popular algorithm is the nonuniform intensity normalization (N3) approach. A particularly salient advantage of this algorithm is that it does not require a prior tissue model for its application. In addition, the source code for N3 is publicly available at the McConnell Brain Imaging Centre (Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University) which includes source code and the coordinating set of perl scripts. This submission describes an implementation of the N3 algorithm for the Insight Toolkit given as a single class, viz.\titk::N3MRIBiasFieldCorrectionImageFilter. We tried to maintain minimal difference between the publicly available MNI N3 implementation and our ITK im- plementation. The only intentional variation is the substitution of an earlier contribution, i.e. the class itk::BSplineScatteredDataPointSetToImageFilter, for the originally proposed least-squares approach for B-spline fitting used to model the bias field. In addition, we include a more extensive modification to the original N3 algorithm found in the class itk::N4MRIBiasFieldCorrectionImageFilter. The latter algorithm employs a multi-resolution approach, similar to FFD image registration strategies, and has a slightly modified iterative update scheme.",

   "abstract": " Branches of tubular structures (vasculature, trachea, neuron, etc.) in medical images are critical for the topology of these structures. In many applications, It is very helpful to be able to decompose tubular structures and identify every individual branch. For example, quantification of geometric vascular features, registration of trachea movement due to respiration, tracing of neuron path. However, manual decomposition can be tedious, time-consuming, and subject to operator bias. In this paper, we propose a novel method to decompose tubular structures automatically and describe how to implement it in ITK framework. The input is a 2D/3D binary image that can be obtained from any segmentation techniques, as well as the junctions, which can be generated automatically from our previously contributed ITK class: itk::JunctionDetectionFilter. The output will be branches with their labels and their connection. There are only two parameters which need to be set by the user. We provide here the implementation as a ITK class: itk::BranchDecompositionFilter.\nPlease cite the following paper if you are interested in our work.\nG. Xiong, C. Chen, J. Chen, Y. Xie, and L.

   "abstract": "An Insight Toolkit (ITK) processing framework for segmenting and tracking nuclei in time-lapse microscopy images using coupled active contours is presented in this paper. We implement the method of Dufour et al.[2] to segment and track cells in fluorescence microscopy images. The basic idea is to model the image as a constant intensity background with constant intensity foreground components. We utilizes our earlier submissions on the Chan and Vese algorithm [1] and its multiphase extension [5] to build our new tracking filter. The tracking filter itk::MultiphaseLevelSetTracking inputs a segmentation result (or a coarse estimate) from the previous time-point along with the feature image and generates a new segmentation output. By iteratively repeating this process across all time-points, real-time tracking is made possible. We include 2D/3D example code, parameter settings and show the results generated on a 2D zebrafish embryo image series.",

   "abstract": "This article provides an implementation of the symmetric log-domain diffeomorphic image registration algorithm, or symmetric demons algorithm for short. It generalizes Thirion's demons and the diffeomorphic demons algorithm. The main practical advantages of the symmetric demons with respect to the other demons variants is that is provides the inverse of the spatial transformation at no additional computational cost and ensures that the registration of image A to image B provides the inverse of the registration from image B to image A. The algorithm works completely in the log-domain, i.e. it uses a stationary velocity field to encode the spatial transformation as its exponential. Within the Insight Toolkit (ITK), the classical demons algorithm is implemented as part of the finite difference solver framework. Our code reuses and extends this generic framework. The source code is composed of a set of reusable ITK filters and classes together with their unit tests. We also provide a small example program that allows the user to compare the different variants of the demons algorithm. This paper gives an overview of the algorithm, an overview of its implementation and a small user guide to ease the use of the registration executable.",

   "abstract": "By default ITK images use a contiguous memory model. This means pixel elements are stored in a single 1-D array, where each element is adjacent in memory to the previous element. However in some situations it is not desirable to use this memory model. This document describes three alternative memory models: slice contiguous, sparse, and single-bit binary images. Slice contiguous images are three-dimensional images, in which each slice is stored in a contiguous 1-D array, but the slices are not necessarily adjacent in memory. Slice contiguous images are well suited for interoperability with applications representing images using DICOM. Sparse images are n-dimensional images, in which each pixel is stored in a hash table data structure. This memory model is well suited for images with very large dimensions, but few pixels which are actually relevant. Single-bit binary images internally represent each pixel as a single-bit, in contrast to eight-bits required to represent a boolean. Single-bit binary images allow very compact representations for on-off masks. Source code, tests, and examples are provided to allow easy reproduction and use.",

   "abstract": "In the Digital Operating Room there is a need to support data streaming to create advanced integrated surgical assist systems. In this paper we propose a DICOM-based streaming mechanism which leverages the interoperability definitions offered by DICOM to offer a common interface to manage all kinds of streaming data sources, while allowing data and application-specific protocols and infrastructure for the actual data access. We have implemented the proposed solution within the ASTMA project and have shown that thanks to the flexibility in choosing an appropriate streaming protocol we can achieve the necessary streaming quality while transmitting the context information required to create valid DICOM instances. This approach ensures an early integration of streaming data with the rest of the imaging information providing for a simpler data workflow.",

   "abstract": "This paper presents an original role-based software architecture facilitating the flexible composition, configuration and collaboration of separated components in the field of computer assisted interventions. Roles, which can be seen as methods dynamically attached to objects, are embedded in components, to limit build level dependencies and improve flexibility. An appropriate component definition and composition language is proposed to declare softwares, without any specific initialization or glue code, this remaining a challenging issue in component oriented programming. The potential of this architecture is illustrated for a software coupling electromagnetic tracking with a robotized system dedicated to the physiological motion rejection in flexible endoscopy. This software consists in several independent components with are combined at runtime thanks to a concise XML-based declaration.",

   "abstract": "Various frameworks and toolkits have been proposed for rapid development of computer assisted intervention (CAI) software. In this paper, we investigate how the open-source 3D Slicer application framework can be used for this purpose. We defined common requirements for CAI software to evaluate and enhance 3D Slicer for interventional applications in general. 3D Slicer is found to be an appropriate end-user deployment environment for CAI software, as its built-in functions fulfill many requirements and missing functionalities can be conveniently added. We describe the implementation of a CAI software based on extending core 3D Slicer functions. Three enhancements are described in detail: the management of workflow, DICOM image transfer, and multiple views. The resulting software fulfills general CAI requirements and supports two different MRI-guided prostate biopsy systems (each with a different imaging mode, robotic manipulator and calibration method), thereby demonstrating the usability of Slicer for implementing different CAI applications.",

   "abstract": "The rapid and \ufb02exible visualization of large amounts of com- \nplex data has become a crucial part in medical image analysis. In re- \ncent years the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) has evolved as the de-facto \nstandard for open-source medical data visualization. It features a clean \ndesign based on a data \ufb02ow paradigm, which the existing wrappers for \nVTK (Python, Tcl/Tk, Simulink) closely follow. This allows to elegantly \nmodel many types of algorithms, but presents a steep learning curve for \nbeginners. In contrast to existing approaches we propose a framework \nfor accessing VTK\u2019s capabilities from within MATLAB, using a syntax \nwhich closely follows MATLAB\u2019s graphics primitives. While providing \nusers with the advanced, fast 3D visualization capabilities MATLAB \ndoes not provide, it is easy to learn while being \ufb02exible enough to allow \nfor complex plots, large amounts of data and combinations of visualiza- \ntions. The proposed framework will be made available as open source \nwith detailed documentation and example data sets. ",

   "abstract": "Developing both graphical and command-line user interfaces for image analysis algorithms requires considerable effort. Generally developers provide limited to very rudimentary user interface controls to their users. These image analysis algorithms can only meet their potential if they can be used easily and frequently by their intended users. Deployment of a large suite of such algorithms on multiple platforms requires that the software be stable and appropriately tested. \n\nWe present a novel framework that allows for rapid development of image analysis algorithms along with graphical user interface controls. Additionally, our framework allows for simplified nightly testing of the algorithms to ensure stability and cross platform interoperability. It allows for development of complex algorithms by creating a custom pipeline where the output of an algorithm can serve as an input for another algorithm. All of the functionality is encapsulation into the object \nrequiring no separate source code for user interfaces, testing or deployment. This makes our framework ideal for developing novel, stable and easy-to-use algorithms for computer assisted interventions (CAI). The framework has been deployed at the Magnetic Resonance Research Center at Yale University and has been released for public use. ",

Image guided surgery with navigational support has the potential to increase surgical accuracy significantly, thus making the operation more reliable. In this article we describe an image guided navigation system for liver surgery. Our platform uses GPU acceleration to display in real-time reconstructed 3-dimensional freehand ultrasound volumes in combination with tracked surgical instruments. We evaluated the accuracy and the performance of our system on a phantom study. The results of our study demonstrate that our image guided navigation system has the potential to introduce significant improvements in the field of liver surgery.",

   "abstract": "The Surgical Assistant Workstation (SAW) modular software framework provides integrated support\nfor robotic devices, imaging sensors, and a visualization pipeline for rapid prototyping of telesurgical\nresearch systems. Subsystems of a telesurgical system, such as the master and slave robots and the visualization\nengine, form a distributed environment that requires an efficient inter-process communication\n(IPC) mechanism. This paper describes the extension of the component-based framework provided by\nthe cisst libraries, on which the SAW depends, from a multi-threaded (local) to a multi-process (networked)\nenvironment. The current implementation uses the Internet Communication Engine (ICE) middleware\npackage, but the design does not depend on ICE and can accomodate other middleware choices.\nA telesurgical robot system based on the da Vinci hardware platform is used as a test case, with a research\napplication that requires coordination between the left and right robot arms (a bimanual knot tying task).\nPerformance measurements on this platform indicate minimal overhead due to the networking.",

   "abstract": "An open standards based modular OR integration system was designed, which is modelled as component-based service-oriented architecture. Medical devices, IT hardware, and software are integrated as independent components and interconnected through a TCP/IP based Ethernet network. The integrated system facilitates service discovery, time synchronization, systems monitoring as well as component control and network administration. Each of the components exposes its semantic information about offered services as service description to peer components. The service description object is based on a generic model and contains all information about attributes, functions, streams as well as information on the used protocols that are required to access the services. An open standards based programming library for the rapid development of server/client components including example modules was developed. A prototype setup of the entire integrated OR system was realized within a demonstrator OR lab.",

   "abstract": "Four-dimensional imaging is a necessary step in computer-assisted interventions (CAI) performed on moving surgical targets, such as those located within the beating heart or influenced by respiratory motion. Ultrasound (US) is often the best imaging modality for this application, as it provides good contrast and spatial resolution while remaining simple to integrate into the operating room. However, conventional 2D US imaging is often insufficient for preoperative planning and surgical guidance, real-time 3D ultrasound imaging using matrix array probes has a smaller field of view and lower spatial resolution, and 3D volumes created using 3D US reconstruction suffer from motion artifacts. As an alternative, gated 4D ultrasound reconstruction using a tracked 2D US probe is a promising technology. In this paper, we present SynchroGrab4D to the open-source community. SynchroGrab4D performs 3D and 4D US reconstruction in real-time while visualizing the output volume(s) within an OpenIGTLink-compliant CAI system, such as 3D Slicer. Also included are VTK classes that perform ECG-gating and that interface with several commercial tracking systems, as well as a 4D Imaging module in 3D Slicer. Our open-source imaging system can be used to collect the 4D image data required for computer-assisted surgical planning and intraoperative guidance for a variety of moving organs.",

   "abstract": "The motivation of the segmentation challenge is to quantitatively analyze global and regional cardiac function from cine magnetic resonance (MR) images, clinical parameters such as ejection fraction (EF), left ventricle myocardium mass (MM), and stroke volume (SV) are required. Calculations of these parameters depend upon accurate delineation of endocardial and epicardial contours of the left ventricle (LV). Manual delineation is time-consuming and tedious and has high inter-observer variability. Thus, fully automatic LV segmentation is desirable. \n\nThe automatic segmentation of the LV in cine MR typically faces four challenges: 1) the overlap between the intensity distributions within the cardiac regions; 2) the lack of edge information; 3) the shape variability of the endocardial and epicardial contours across slices and phases; and 4) the inter-subject variability of these factors. A number of methods have been proposed for (semi-) automatic LV segmentation, including using a probability atlas [1], dynamic programming [2-3], fuzzy clustering [4], a deformable model [5], an active appearance model [6], a variational and level set [7-10], graph cuts [11-12] and an image-driven approach [13]. For a complete review of recent literature describing cardiac segmentation techniques, see [14]. Although the segmentation results have improved, accurate LV segmentation is still acknowledged as a difficult problem.\n\nThe goals of this contest are to compare LV segmentation methods by providing an evaluation system, and a database of images and expert contours. Comparing segmentation results across research studies can be difficult due to unspecified differences in the method or implementation of evaluation metrics. This contest will provide open-source code for contour evaluation. Furthermore, the database will provide a set of images such that confounding segmentation differences due to image quality or pathology could be eliminated.",

   "abstract": "This document describes the surgical robot console system based on 3D Slicer for image-guided surgery. Considering the image-guided surgery, since image workstations have complex User Interface (UI) and extra functions, it is supposed that such UI is not suitable for surgeon who is the robot operator. The proposed robot console is designed as a simple UI for the robot operator, which can display the endoscopic video image, the sensor data, the robot status and simple images for guiding the surgery. Therefore, we expect that the surgeon can concentrate on the operation itself by utilizing the robot console. On the other hand, since the robot console system is based on 3D Slicer, the robot console can use the abundant image operation functions. Moreover, it can use the flexibility of tool connectivities by using the OpenIGTLink protocol. In addition, since the video image is captured by using the multifunctional library OpenCV , we can expect the extensibility about the function of the proposed system.",

   "abstract": "A vessel lumen centerline extraction method is presented. Its preprocessing and initialization for the application to 3D CT angiography (CTA) image volumes are also described. This approach is based upon the theory of principal curves to finding lumen axis. Meanwhile, it also estimates the lumen local width with an 1D intensity model that depicts an ideal lumen cross-sectional profile. We tested the method on 46 CTA datasets supplied with the Carotid Lumen Segmentation and Stenosis Grading Challenge (CLS) of the ``3D Segmentation in the Clinic: a Grade Challenge'', a 2009 MICCAI Workshop. The evaluation of 31 testing datasets suggests that our method can provide a good basis for post-processing if high accuracy of segmentation and stenosis grading is desired.",

   "abstract": "We propose a method for segmenting and labeling the main head and neck vessels (common, internal, external carotid and vertebral arteries) from a contrast enhanced computed tomography angiography (CTA) volume. First, an initial centerline of each vessel is extracted. Next, the vessels are segmented using 3D active objects initialized using the first step. Finally, the true centerline is identified by smoothly deforming it away from the segmented mask edges using a spline-snake. \n\nWe focus particularly on the initial centerline extraction technique. It uses a locally adaptive front propagation algorithm that attempts to find the optimal path connecting the ends of the vessel, typically from the lowest image of the scan to the Circle of Willis in the brain. It uses a patient adapted anatomical model of the different vessels both to initialize and constrain this fast marching, thus eliminating the need for manual selection of seed points. \n\nThe method is evaluated by applying it to the datasets of the MICCAI 2009 carotid bifurcation challenge, for which this paper is the only fully automatic method submitted. \n",

The method includes an adaptation of statistical shape models of the mandible, the skull base and the midfacial bones, followed by a simultaneous graph-based optimization of adjacent deformable models. The adaptation of the models to the image data is performed according to a heuristic model of the typical intensity distribution in the vincinity of the bone boundary, with special focus on an accurate discrimination of adjacent bones in joint regions. An evaluation of our method based on 18 CT scans shows that a manual correction of the automatic segmentations is not necessary in approx. 60% of the axial slices that contain the mandible.",

   "abstract": "The 2009 MICCAI Head and Neck Auto-Segmentation Challenge was aimed at assessing algorithms for automated segmentation of the brain stem and mandible from CT images for use in radiotherapy planning. The organisers provided 10 datasets with associated manual segmentations by experts, and 8 test datasets on which the algorithms had to be run. In two of the test datasets (subjects 13 and 15) the field of view was truncated. The results were independently analysed by the organisers.\n\nTo address the problem posed by the challenge we describe a method based on active appearance models (AAMs) which involves four stages: Initialisation with a parts-and-geometry model, search with a global AAM followed by search with local AAMs, then post-processing using linear regressors.\n\nApplication of the method to the test images resulted in a mean (excluding subject 13) Dice overlap value of 76.1 +/- 5.1% for the mandible, and 72.9 +/- 24.6% for the brainstem. The method failed to segment both the mandible and brainstem in subject 13, and the whilst giving a successful segmentation of the mandible in subject 15, gave poor results on the brainstem. It takes about 10 minutes to run on a 64 bit Linux workstation with 2GB RAM, and a 2GHz pentium processor. We were encouraged by its performance on this dataset, and believe that its accuracy can be improved with some modifications to the segmentation pipeline.\n",

The proposed method is a hybrid method that combines two aspects. First, we register the atlas image to the image to be segmented using an intensity-based non-rigid image registration algorithm based on B-spline, the corresponding binary image of the atlas is also resampled into the reference image coordinate system according to the deformation field obtained from the registration process. Second, based on the initialization of the deformed atlas binary mask, the level set function is evolved to segment the object of interest in the test image. The proposed method was tested on CT images of head and neck and compared with expert segmentation of mandible and brainstem. The evaluation results show the method is available and effective.",

   "abstract": "This paper presents automated segmentation of structures in the Head and Neck (H&N) region, using an active contour-based joint registration and segmentation model. A new atlas selection strategy is also used. Segmentation is performed based on the dense deformation field computed from the registration of selected structures in the atlas image that have distinct boundaries, onto the patient's image. This approach results in robust segmentation of the structures of interest, even in the presence of tumors, or anatomical differences between the atlas and the patient image. For each patient, an atlas image is selected from the available atlas-database, based on the similarity metric value, computed after performing an affine registration between each image in the atlas-database and the patient's image. Unlike many of the previous approaches in the literature, the similarity metric is not computed over the entire image region; rather, it is computed only in the regions of soft tissue structures to be segmented. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the results is presented.",

This is done by adding one dimension for the local radius around the centerline. The crucial step of our method is the definition of the local metrics to minimize. We have chosen to exploit the tubular structure of the vessels one wants to extract to built an anisotropic metric giving higher speed on the center of the vessels and also when the minimal path tangent is coherent with the vessel\u2019s direction.

Three initial points are provided as input, belonging to the Common, the External and the Internal Carotid Arteries. Our algorithm is divided into two main steps: first, two minimal cost paths are tracked between the CCA and both the ECA and the ICA. The cost functions are based on a multiscale vesselness response. Second, after detecting the junction position and cutting or extending the paths based on the requested lengths, a level set segmentation is initialized as a thin tube around the computed paths and evolves until reaching the vessel wall or a maximal evolution time. Results on training and testing datasets are presented and compared to the manual segmentation by three observers, based on a ground truth and using four quality measures.\n",

   "abstract": "The arterial lumen is modeled by a spatially continuous right generalized cylinder with piece-wise constant parameters. The method is the identifies the parameters of each cylinder piece from a series of planar contours extracted along an approximate axis of the artery. This curve is defined by a minimal path between the artery end-points. The contours are extracted by use of a 2D Fast Marching algorithm. The identification of the axial parameters is based on a geometrical analogy with piece-wise helical curves, while the identification of the surface parameters uses the Fourier series decomposition of the contours. Thus identified parameters are used as observations in a Kalman optimal estimation scheme that manages the spatial consistency from each piece to another. The method was was evaluated on 15 training and 31 testing datasets from the MICCAI 3D Segmentation in the Clinic Grand Challenge: Carotid Bifurcation Lumen Segmentation and Stenosis Grading (http://cls2009.bigr.nl/).",

This goal is facilitated through an evaluation system and a database of cardiac cine MR images, as well as expert contours, now freely available on the internet for research purposes. This challenge is important because the analysis and the segmentation of 3D+t sequences of MR cardiac images is fastidious, time consuming and error-prone for human operators, due to the large amount of data. Conversely, automated segmentation of cardiac images is well-known to be a challenging task.\nThis paper describes the method that our group submitted for the challenge, based on 4D discrete mathematical morphology. This method leads to discrete segmentations, i.e, binary masks (bitmaps) of the left ventricular myocardiums that are both spatially and temporally consistent.",

   "abstract": "The segmentation of left ventricular structures is necessary for the evaluation of the ejection fraction (EF) and the myocardial mass (LVM). A semi-automated 2D algorithm using connected filters and a deformable model allowing an accurate endocardial detection was proposed. The epicardial border was deduced using a deformable model restricted inside a region of interest defined from the endocardial border. Papillary muscles were detected using a fuzzy k-means algorithm. The method was applied to the challenge training and validation databases, consisting of 15 subjects each. The evaluation was performed using the tools provided by the challenge. For both datasets, results show a mean Dice metric of 0.89 for endocardial borders (0.92 for epicardial borders). Overall average perpendicular distance was 2.2 mm. Very good correlation was obtained for the EF and LVM parameters. Visual overall rating given by the challenge\u2019s cardiologist was 1.2. Segmentation was robust and performed successfully on both datasets. ",

   "abstract": "This study investigates a fully automatic left ventricle segmentation method from cine short axis MR images. Advantages of this method include that it: 1) is image-driven and does not require manually drawn initial contours. 2) provides not only endocardial and epicardial contours, but also papillary muscles and trabeculations\u2019 contours; 3) introduces a roundness measure that is fast and automatically locates the left ventricle; 4) simplifies the epicardial contour segmentation by mapping the pixels from Cartesian to approximately polar coordinates; and 5) applies a fast Fourier transform to smooth the endocardial and epicardial contours. Quantitative evaluation was performed on the 15 subjects of the MICCAI 2009 Cardiac MR Left Ventricle Segmentation hallenge. The average perpendicular distance between manually drawn and automatically selected contours over all slices, all studies, and two phases (end-diastole and end-systole) was 2.07 0.61 mm for endocardial and 1.91 0.63 mm for epicardial contours. These results indicate a promising method for automatic segmentation of left ventricle for clinical use.",

After localizing the left ventricle blood pool using motion, thresholding and clustering, slices are segmented sequentially. For each slice, deformable registration is used to align all the phases, candidate contours are recovered in the average image using shortest paths, and a minimal surface is built to generate the final contours. The advantage of our method is that the resulting contours follow the edges in each phase and are consistent over time. As part of the MICCAI grand challenge on left ventricle segmentation, we demonstrate using 15 training datasets and 15 validation datasets that the results are very good with average errors around 2 mm and the method is ready for clinical routine.",

   "abstract": "Treatment planning for high precision radiotherapy of head and neck (H&N) cancer patients requires accurate delineation of critical structures. Manual contouring is tedious and often suffers from large inter- and intra-rater variability. In this paper, we present a fully automated, atlas-based segmentation method and apply it to tackle the H&N CT image segmentation problem in the MICCAI 2009 3D Segmentation\nGrand Challenge. The proposed method employs a multiple atlas fusion strategy and a hierarchical atlas registration approach. We also exploit recent advancements in GPU technology to accelerate the deformable atlas registration and to make multi-atlas segmentation computationally feasible in practice. Validation results on the eight clinical datasets distributed by the MICCAI workshop showed that the proposed method gave very accurate segmentation of the mandible and the brainstem, with a volume\noverlap close to or above 90% for most subjects. These results suggest that our method is clinically applicable, accurate, and may significantly reduce manual labor and improve contouring efficiency.",

However, we are still unable to replicate the warps from the\nstable and well verified implementation of this algorithm\nurl{http://sites.google.com/site/yeoyeo02/software/sphericaldemonsrelease}.\n\nWe find the average warp discrepancies between the original implementation and ITK\nimplementation to be about 5.3 mm on a sphere of radius 100.0 mm (note that\nwe do not expect a 100% agreement because of implementation differences, but\n5.3 mm is relatively large). The submission also includes cortical surface\nmeshes of 39 subjects and the corresponding segmentation labels of the cortical\nsurfaces. Ultimately, the best validation would be to compare the overlap of\nthese segmentation labels after registration. We welcome fellow ITK developers\nto work on this.\n\nPlease note that this ITK implementation of the algorithm is\ncurrently being reviewed and tested in the NAMIC Sandbox at:\nurl{http://svn.na-mic.org/NAMICSandBox/trunk/QuadEdgeMeshSphericalDiffeomorphicDemonsRegistration/}.\n\n\nIf you want access to the stable and well verified implementation of this\nalgorithm, please use the MATLAB code available at:\nurl{http://sites.google.com/site/yeoyeo02/software/sphericaldemonsrelease}.\n\n\nThis document describes a contribution to the Insight Toolkit intended to support the process of performing deformable registration on two Meshes. The method implemented here is restricted to Meshes with a Spherical geometry and topology, and with scalar values associated to their nodes. The code described here is an implementation of the paper \u201cSpherical Demons: Fast Diffeomorphic Landmark-Free Surface Registration\u201d by Yeo, Sabuncu, Vercauteren, Ayache, Fischl and Golland [3, 4].\n\nThis paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and output data that we used for validating the algorithm described in this paper. This adheres to the fundamental principle that scientific publications must facilitate reproducibility of the reported results.",

The region is grown into the query pixel based only on the difference between the query pixel and neighboring pixels that are already members of the region. This allows the region to be grown along paths that change gradually over time and end up looking nothing like they originally did. This is usefully in many situation, including growing surface patches around bends using growth criteria on the normal vectors. The usage and structure of these classes follow the style of itkConnectedThresholdImageFilter. We propose these classes as addition to the Insight Toolkit.",

Therefore there is a crying need to bring about a paradigm shift in the quality of health care delivery and to monitor and sustain it. It is obvious that those institutions, which are quality conscious and are committed to continuous quality improvement, will gain the highest consumer acceptance and will flourish at the expense of others. The 'Quality Revolution', as it is sometimes referred to, is nothing but putting the patient at the heart of health care and wrapping the care around it, rather than the other way around. Quality Measuring and assessing service is important, particularly when multiple sources of variation are present. Analyzing all medical processes to remove rework and waste could build health care quality and lead to significant reductions in patient cost. The use of quality-assurance programs and statistical tools can be directly applied to health-care organizations with improved quality of patient's objectives and the results of care from the patient's viewpoint.",

   "abstract": "Segmentation of the left ventricle is important in assessment of cardiac functional parameters. Currently, manual segmentation is the gold standard for acquiring these parameters and can be time-consuming. Therefore, accuracy and automation are two important criteria in improving cardiac image segmentation methods. In this paper, we present a comprehensive approach that utilizes various features of cine MR images and combines multiple image processing methods including thresholding, edge detection, mathematical morphology, deformable model as well as image filtering. The segmentation is performed automatically with minimized interaction to optimize segmentation results. This approach provides cardiac radiologists a practical method for accurate segmentation of the left ventricle.",

The DiscreteGaussianImageFilter is then used to blur the higher dimensional image. The discrete Gaussian image filter was chosen because the kernel width used should usually be small due to the down-sampling involved when using this technique. As described in the ITK documentation, this class should outperform the recursive Gaussian algorithm due to the small kernel size DiscreteGaussianImageFilter.After the Gaussian blur has been completed the data will be interpolated and written to the output image.\n\nBy incorporating this class into the ITK framework, this more efficient algorithm will be made available to all ITK users.",

Statistical shape analysis methods have emerged within the last decade to allow for a localized analysis of shape. Most shape analysis frameworks are though lacking a good statistical underpinning, as they commonly do not allow for the inclusion of independent variables such as age, gender or clinical\nscores. This work presents a unified method for local shape analysis that can accomodate different number of variates and contrasts. It also allows to include any number of associated variables in the statistical analysis of the data. Several cases of study are given to clarify the explanation of the different types of data that can be analyzed and the parameters that can be used to tune the program shapeAnalysisMANCOVA. This tool has been designed to interact seamlessly with the existing UNC SPHARM-PDM based shape analysis toolbox.",

   "abstract": "In recent years, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) scanners have become more prevalent in the scientific community. They capture a \"2.5-D\" image of a scene by sending out thousands of laser pulses and using time-of-flight calculations to determine the distance to the first reflecting surface in the scene. Rather than setting up a collection of objects in real life and actually sending lasers into the scene, one can simply create a scene out of 3d models and \"scan\" it by casting rays at the models. This is a great resource for any researchers who work with 3D model/surface/point data and LiDAR data. The synthetic scanner can be used to produce data sets for which a ground truth is known in order to ensure algorithms are behaving properly before moving to \"real\" LiDAR scans. Also, noise can be added to the points to attempt to simulate a real LiDAR scan for researchers who do not have access to the very expensive equipment required to obtain real scans.",

   "abstract": "Many neuroanatomy studies rely on brain tissue segmentation in Magnetic Resonance images (MRI). The Expectation-Maximization (EM) theory offers a popular framework for this task. We studied the EM algorithm developed at the Surgical Planning Laboratory (SPL) at Harvard Medical School and implemented in the Slicer3 software. We observed that the segmentation lacks accuracy if the image exhibits some intensity inhomogeneity. Moreover the optimum parameters are challenging to estimate. This document aims at describing our solutions within the context of statistical modeling. Our contributions range from algorithm improvements to novel representations of the statistical distribution model. First we added a bias field correction module and exposed the most significant parameters. Second we proposed a new way to select the distribution of the tissues to be segmented. Finally we designed a set of interactive tools to make the segmentation process easier and more accurate. To validate the new segmentation pipeline, we performed our experiments on MRI data and a clinical expert evaluated our results.\n\nThe source code developed for this work, i.e. the code of the MRIBiasFieldCorrection and EMSegment modules, is part of Slicer3 version 3.5 and can be downloaded by this command: svn co http://svn.slicer.org/Slicer3/trunk Slicer3",

   "abstract": "An Insight Toolkit (ITK) algorithm for detection of spherical objects using Hough methods with voting is presented in this paper. Currently, the usage of Hough methods for detecting linear and circular elements exists for 2D images in ITK. The current work extends those filters in several ways. Firstly, the new filters operate on N-dimensional images. Secondly, they work in physical coordinates which is quite essential in medical imaging modalities. Thirdly, they are optimized (multi-threaded execution, stratified sampling etc.) for usage on large datasets and show a significant speedup even in 2D and on small images. Our implementation follows the same underlying mathematics of Hough transforms (as implemented by the 2D filters) but with some minor variations. The main variation lies in the pattern of voting that involves selecting voting regions easily and efficiently accessible to region iterators rather than cones that are difficult to generalize in higher dimensions. We include 2D example code, parameter settings and show the results generated on embryonic images of the zebrafish from optical microscopy.",

Specifically, the algorithm first \ndetects the centerline representations between the user placed seed points. This centerline extraction algorithm is based on a minimal path \ndetection algorithm which operates on a {\\em medialness} map. The lumen of corotid arteries is extracted by using \nthe global optimal graph-cuts algorithm~\\cite{boykov:01} using the centerlines as input. The radius information contained \nin the centerline representation\nis used to normalize the gradient based weights of the graph. It is shown that this algorithm can sucessfully segment the carotid arteries without\nincluding calcified and non-calcified plaques in the segmentation results.",

This is a common requirement for transferring expert manual segmentations from radiotherapy treatment planning software into external image analysis environments (such as ITK). We provide an implementation of RT structure set importing and give some example results from prostate cancer radiotherapy planning volumes. \n\nPlease note that this implementation requires GDCM 2.0 to be installed (this is trivial; however this requirement is the reason for the low automatic testing score by the Insight-Journal Dashboard).\n\nPlease Note: Updated June 2010 for a couple of minor issues (pls. see comments in .cxx) and to remove the requirement for image template. This code now reads the dcm directory and creates a 3D volume and associated binary structure volumes (all in NIfTI format).\nUsage: itkDICOMRT DicomDirectory inputDICOMRTImageFile OutputFilePrefix\n\nFeb 2013: Please note that this code won't work with ITK4 and above - instead please see: http://hdl.handle.net/10380/3401 .

   "abstract": "An Insight Toolkit (ITK) algorithm for adaptively thresholding images is presented in this paper. Currently, the usage of thresholding methods in ITK has made use of global thresholds, confidence connected thresholds and neighborhood strategies. The current work extends these family of filters by setting thresholds adaptively in local image regions. The user is not required to specify seed regions apriori which greatly eases the task of automatic segmentation. The thresholds are determined using Otsu's minimization of between-class variances in local image regions that are selected randomly throughout the domain. Using non-uniformly sampled thresholds, a continuous function is reconstructed throughout the image domain using a B-Spline approximation algorithm. Hence, the image domain is adaptively sampled by making use of the reconstructed threshold function. Most imaging modalities introduce some intensity inhomogeneities that can be recovered by this method. ",

   "abstract": "This document introduces a program based on the algorithm described by Maria Cristina Tugurlan. The program uses file readers, image filters, and file writers from the Insight Toolkit ITK www.itk.org. It produces as output an image whose values are the times of first arrival of a wavefront that spreads from seed points with a speed at every point equal to the input image intensity. It performs the computation in parallel on distributed memory computers using the Message Passing Interface MPI. Each MPI process reads a small piece of the input image into memory. It computes fast marching on its piece. It sends and receives the values from fast marching at piece boundaries. It recalculates fast marching a number of times set from the command line using the new boundary values each time. Each MPI process writes only a small piece of the output file.\n\nA substantial difference is seen when the output of MPI fast marching is compared to the output of serial fast marching. This difference may be acceptable for some uses. The program should be able to handle input images that are too large to fit in the memory of a single computer.",

   "abstract": "Segmentation forms the onset for image analysis especially for medical images, making any abnormalities in tissues distinctly visible. Possible application includes the detection of tumor boundary in SPECT, MRI or electron MRI (EMRI). Nevertheless, tumors being heterogeneous pose a great problem when automatic segmentation is attempted to accurately detect the region of interest (ROI). Consequently, it is a challenging task to design an automatic segmentation algorithm without the incorporation of 'a priori' knowledge of an organ being imaged. To meet this challenge, here we propose an intelligence-based approach integrating evolutionary k-means algorithm within multi-resolution framework for feature segmentation with higher accuracy and lower user interaction cost. The approach provides several advantages. First, spherical coordinate transform (SCT) is applied on original RGB data for the identification of variegated coloring as well as for significant computational overhead reduction. Second the translation invariant property of the discrete wavelet frames (DWF) is exploited to define the features, color and texture using chromaticity of LL band and luminance of LH and HL band respectively. Finally, the genetic algorithm based K-means (GKA), which has the ability to learn intelligently the distribution of different tissue types without any prior knowledge, is adopted to cluster the feature space with optimized cluster centers. \nExperimental results of proposed algorithm using multi-modality images such as MRI, SPECT, and EMRI are presented and analyzed in terms of error measures to verify its effectiveness and feasibility for medical applications.",

   "abstract": "Region growing is a technique that can be used to propagate information over a mesh. In a previous submission, \"A Mesh Front Iterator for VTK\", we introduced an iterator that can be used with vtkPointSet subclasses to traverse a mesh. It is sometimes useful to visit only vertices that are \"similar\" to their neighbors by some definition. This concept can be used to select many types of common regions, including planar regions or regions with similar color, to name a few. In this paper, we propose an iterator which propagates on a mesh using a condition test which can be easily modified.\n\nThe latest code is available here: https://github.com/daviddoria/MeshConditionalFrontIterator",

   "abstract": "The image registration framework in the Insight Tookit offers a powerful body of code for finding the optimal spatial transform that registers one image with another. However, ITK currently lacks a way to fit parametric models of image pixel values to an input image. This document describes new classes that enable use of the registration framework to provide this capability. We describe a new base class, itk::ParametricImageSource, that defines an interface for parametric image sources. An adapter class itk::ImageToParametricImageSourceMetric that enables itk::ParametricImageSources to be hooked into the registration framework is also described. An example adapter class that enables the existing itk::GaussianImageSource to be used for image fitting is presented, and we demonstrate use of the classes by fitting a 2D Gaussian function to an image generated by the itk::GaussianImageSource class.",

   "abstract": "Ultrasound is a very useful and convenient modality in medical imaging, due to its relatively small footprint, high resolution, negligible adverse effects, and real-time imaging capability -- in spite of its well-known artifacts. However, it is fairly difficult to fully benefit from its resolution and speed in advanced imaging research because of the closed nature of most ultrasound systems.\n\nWe propose a modular and extensible open-source toolkit MUSiiC S/W for rapid development and system setup for ultrasound research. Aimed at algorithm and experimental system builders as well as at clinical research, it allows standardized access to various types of ultrasound-derived real-time data streams, incorporates various tracking facilities, volume reconstruction, and connections to external software tools. By providing well-defined open standard interfaces between those building blocks, we aim at easy extensibility for third-party researchers.",

The framework includes a library of components that can be used to implement master-slave or collaborative robot control systems with support for complex video\npipelines and a novel interactive surgical visualization environment. SAW includes standardized interface definitions (e.g., command names and payloads), with the goal of making the framework easily extensible so that developers can add support for their own robotic devices and associated hardware platforms.

The majority of these systems comes from different vendors and has different user interface designs and interaction schemes. This diversity introduces a high risk of accidental misuse, which is critical in the surgical domain. The proposed framework integrates user interfaces of heterogeneous components into one central control console using a uniform screen design and interaction scheme. To accomplish this, the standards Universal Remote Console (URC) and Device Profiles for Web Services (DPWS) have been combined and integrated. The prototype results are demonstrated in the ICCAS integrated operating room.",

The method first computes the shortest path between two user provided points in the vessel and then performs a graph min-cut based segmentation of the vessel based on the intensity information coupled with the computed path as a spatial constraint. The shortest path computation is adapted from the algorithm in [1] to use a vesselness based weighting function. The min-cut algorithm uses the Boost graph library to calculate the minimal cut. Several examples of applications are provided, along with images of the resulting segmentations.",

   "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to present our extension of the MITK toolkit by a real-time navigation system for computer assisted surgery. The system was developed with laparoscopic partial nephrectomies as a first application scenario. The main goal of the application is to enable tracking of the tumor position and orientation during surgery. Our system is based on ultrasound to CT registration and electromagnetic tracking. The basic idea is to process tracking information to generate an augmented reality (AR) visualization of a tumor model in the camera image of a laparoscopic camera. Our system will enhance the surgeon\u2019s view on the current scene and therefore facilitates higher safety during the surgery. A key intention of the development was to use only open source toolkits such as VTK, MITK and OpenCV in order to implement the desired functionality. So far we have applied our system in vitro in two phantom trials with a surgeon which yielded promising results.",

The method operates by dividing the surface into a number of small cubes called cuberilles. Each cuberille is centered at a pixel lying on the iso-surface and then quadrilaterals are generated for each face. The original approach is improved by projecting the vertices of each cuberille onto the implicit surface, smoothing the typical block-like resultant mesh. Source code and examples are provided to demonstrate the method.",

ITK already contains a \ufb01lter for resampling scalar and vector images as well as several transformation and interpolation classes. However, due to the directional nature of DT images, using the existing classes would result in losing the structural information of the image.\n We developed a new resampling \ufb01lter, speci\ufb01c to DTI, that preserves the structure by applying a rotation directly on the tensors while performing the transformation of the image. New transformation and interpolator classes have also been implemented to handle tensors correctly. The new transformation classes are based on algorithms described by D.C. Alexander et al. Finally, three \ufb01lters have been written to correct symmetric semi-de\ufb01nite matrices that would no longer be positive after the resampling process and project them into the tensors\u2019 space. In addition, a software based on the new classes has been developed and is provided with this article.",

Image samplers take a set of `picks' from an image and store them in an array. A sample consists of the location of the pick (a point) and the corresponding image intensity (a value). Image samplers are useful for image registration, where samples are drawn from the fixed image in order to compute the similarity measure. Together with an image sampler base class, we introduce the following image samplers: 1) a full sampler that draws all voxel coordinates from the input image, 2) a grid sampler that draws samples from a user-specified regular voxel grid, 3 and 4) two random samplers that uniformly draw a user-specified number of samples from the input image.\n\nThis paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and output data that the authors used for validating the algorithm described in this paper.",

   "abstract": "Teleoperation is currently the dominant form of instrument control for surgical robotics. For example, the mechanical masters in the da Vinci surgical system provides a stable, precise interface for teleoperation, allowing execution of delicate tasks in complex surgical procedures. However, conventional teleoperation also adds the complexity of false feedback to the user from the interaction of the master manipulators with each other and other elements of the surgical console. Conventional teleoperation also has other inherent performance and accuracy limitations due to the mechanical devices integrated in such a system. As an alternative, we outline a hands-free system that could be improved without significant hardware redesign, and provide a sterile master workspace. Our ReachIN prototype is implemented by extending the Johns Hopkins University Surgical Assistant Workstation (SAW) framework to include additional vision interfaces and control methods. We present the design of this prototype and results from initial validation experiments.",

   "abstract": "Research and development of image guided surgery techniques requires software that provides a high degree of flexibility, with easy access to reliable functionality for common tasks. The goal of this paper is to highlight this claim in the context of image guided cardiac surgery applications. Cardiac surgery traditionally involves very invasive surgical procedures. Minimally invasive surgical techniques can greatly reduce the invasiveness of these procedures, thus reducing patient trauma. Implementing new image guidance systems for cardiac surgery is a complex process, requiring the integration of a wide variety of physical and software systems, involving both research and clinical personnel. Modular software design is essential to accommodate this complexity. Furthermore, software architecture must be highly flexible in order to facilitate both the adaptability necessary in research, and the tested reliability needed for clinical applications. Over the past decade, our laboratory has created a comprehensive system for research and development, testing and implementation of new surgical guidance techniques in the operating room. This paper provides an overview of our approach to the development and implementation of image guided therapy software for cardiovascular surgeries, ranging from the simple (needle guidance for central line access) to highly complex and experimental (intracardiac beating heart mitral valve repair/replacement).

   "abstract": "The deconvolution, also called deblurring, tries to revert the optical distortion introduced during the aquisition of the image. It is a family of image processing which can be classed in the larger family of image restoration.\nDeconvolution is a very difficult problem, and many algorithms have been proposed to solve it, with different strenght and weakness which may depend on the context where they are used. As a consequence, it is desirable to have several algorithms available when trying to restore some images. The different algorithms are often built on a similar principle, making possible to share a large part of their API in their implementation. Also, the most generic operations related to deconvolution should be reusable in order to avoid code duplication and ease the implementation of new algorithms.\n\nIn this contribution, the infrastructure for the implementation of several deconvolution algorithms is proposed. Based on this infrastructure, twelve simple deconvolution algorithms of reference are also provided.\n",

   "abstract": "The development of segmentation algorithms for liver tumors in CT scans has found growing attention in recent years. The validation of these methods, however, is often treated as a subordinate task. In this article, we review existing approaches and present \frst steps towards a new methodology that evaluates the quality of an algorithm in relation to the variability of manual delineations. We obtained three manual segmentations for 50 liver lesions and computed the results of a segmentation algorithm. We compared all four masks with each other and with different ground truth estimates and calculated scores according to the validation framework from the MICCAI challenge 2008. Our results show some cases where this more elaborate evaluation reflects the segmentation quality in a more adequate way than traditional approaches. The concepts can also be extended to other similar segmentation problems.",

   "abstract": "ITK is one of the most powerful image segmentation and registration libraries available as an open source toolkit. Motivated by the recent popularization of the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad, in this work, we describe the set of required steps for integrating the ITK framework into Apple\u2019s iOS mobile operating system. Our focus in this paper is on the process of importing the C++ based ITK to the Objective-C based iOS, and creating a simple application that demonstrates the ITK libraries are integrated. This paper brings to the reader a user-manual on how to integrate the ITK libraries into iOS applications and code. We present here the series of steps we performed in order to import the ITK libraries as well as report the results of importing them under different versions of the iOS and under different architectures (the Simulator and Device architecture).",

   "abstract": "This document describes the use and implementation of first and second order spatial derivatives of coordinate transformations in the Insight Toolkit url{www.itk.org}). Spatial derivatives are useful for many types of regularising or penalty terms frequently used in image registration. These derivatives are dubbed 'SpatialJacobian' and 'SpatialHessian' to distinguish with the derivative to the transformation parameters themselves, which is called `Jacobian' in the ITK.\n\nIn addition to the spatial derivatives, we derived and implemented the derivatives to the registration/transform parameters of these spatial derivatives, required for gradient descent type optimisation routines. These derivatives are implemented in a sparse manner, reducing the computation time for transformations which have local support. All of these derivatives are implemented for the most common ITK coordinate transformation, such as the rigid, affine and B-spline transformation. In addition we derive formulae and code for arbitrary compositions of transformations. The spatial derivatives were subsequently exploited by implementing the bending energy penalty term.\n\nThis paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and output data that the authors used for validating the algorithm described in this paper. This adheres to the fundamental principle that scientific publications must facilitate reproducibility of the reported results.\n",

   "abstract": "In this paper, we analyze the relationship between parameters of brain tumors obtained through in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in vivo magneticnresonance spectroscopy (MRS), and ex vivo immunohistochemistry (IHC). The goal of our project is to provide a quantitative definition of tumor cellularity based on the in vivo parameters. Biopsy samples obtained from previously untreated patients with a diagnosis of GBM are used to find the link between imaging parameters at the specific biopsy locations and IHC parameters from the corresponding tissue samples. A functional tree (FT) model of tumor cellularity is learned from the in vivo parameters and the remaining histological parameters. The tumor cellularity model is then tested on examples which contain only in vivo parameters, by first estimating the remaining IHC parameters by applying the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, and then using the complete parameter vector for classification.",

   "abstract": "This paper presents a technique for immunostaining biomarker detection in digital slides. We treat immunostaining detection as a color image analysis problem and build statistical color models using a large number of labeled positive and negative immunostaining pixels. We have implemented the statistical models in different color spaces and show that the opponent chromaticity signals effectively characterize the color distributions of the immunostaining biomarkers and that the luminance is an unreliable and distractive signal. We have applied the technique to the detection of positive P53 immunostaining in digital slides of oesophagitis and colorectal biopsies. We present experimental results and show that the technique can achieve a biomarker detection rate of over 98% with 5% false positives. ",

   "abstract": "This paper presents a method for nonlinear registration of images, where there exists no one-to-one correspondence in parts of the image. Such a situation occurs for instance in the case where an atlas of normal anatomy shall be matched to pathological data, such as tumors, resections or lesions. Our idea is to use local confidence weights and to model pathological regions with zero confidence. We integrate this concept into the efficient and publicly available diffeomorphic demons registration framework. Finally, we show that this process better captures deformations in high-confidence regions than without using the proposed modification. Furthermore, it is easy to implement and runs faster than previous approaches.",

Each point on the fixed mesh is warped according to the displacement vector saved in the deformation field and gets a scalar value assigned by interpolating the scalar value from the moving mesh. An interpolator is needed to apply this filter.\nThis paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and output data that we used for validating the algorithm described in this paper. This adheres to the fundamental principle that scientific publications must facilitate reproducibility of the reported results.",

The algorithm has been shown to be both faster and more accurate than those currently implemented in ITK.\n",

In many implementations the algorithm is tightly integrated with code pertaining to a specific parametric object. In this paper we introduce a generic RANSAC implementation that is independent of the estimated object. Thus, the user is able to ignore outlying data elements potentially found in their input. To illustrate the use of the algorithm we implement the required components for estimating the parameter values of a hyperplane and hypersphere.\n",

   "abstract": "We have created a wrapper package named SimVTK that allows VTK, and third-party classes derived from VTK classes, to be seamlessly integrated with MATLAB's Simulink interface. Our package generates a loadable Simulink module for each VTK class, which is then represented as a \"block\" on the Simulink canvas, and can be connected with other blocks to form a pipeline. Each block can be double-clicked to bring up a dialog box that allows introspection and control of the VTK class. After a VTK pipeline has been built, it can be run interactively from within Simulink. The outputs of the pipeline can be displayed in an interactive render window, written to a disk file, or exported to a MATLAB variable. Within Simulink, the VTK pipeline can also be connected to the ITK pipeline through the use of our SimITK package. We generate the VTK-Simulink wrapper automatically though the use of CMake build scripts, with XML as an intermediate representation of the VTK class interfaces.\n",

   "abstract": "Recently, Birkfellner et al. proposed a novel image-to-image merit function (stochastic rank correlation, SRC) for robust intensity-based 2D/3D image registration. In this work, we summarize the basic idea of SRC, and present a generic ITK-based implementation of this image-to-image metric including tests for software veri\ufb01cation. Moreover, we provide two simple examples that demonstrate the usage of this metric: a) within the native ITK 2D/3D image registration method, and b) within a recently published extended ITK-based 2D/3D registration framework. It is, however, important to note, that this paper neither covers a comprehensive evaluation of SRC, nor a comparison with other metrics. It rather shows that SRC appears to succeed on a femoral and a porcine data set in the course of ITK-based 2D/3D image registration.\n",

   "abstract": "Topological considerations for segmentation results are important for such applications as proper brain segmentation from digital image data. We present an enhancement of the FastMarchingImageFilter which allows for topologically constrained evolution of the level set. Identical to the original functionality of the FastMarchingImageFilter, the evolution of the level set of a single or multiple genus zero, well-composed seed objects proceeds according to the specified parameters. With our proposed enhancements, the user can either choose to prevent the level set from merging with itself such that the original topology of the initial seed object(s) is not violated or that no handles are created during the evolution process. However, in contrast to earlier approaches which relied on the concept of the simple point implicitly requiring the definition of a user-specified foreground/background connectivity, we use the related, but more restrictive concept of well-composed sets to topologically constrain the evolution of the level set. Utility of our submission is demonstrated on both 2-D and 3-D brain images. Note that this submission is a companion piece to a more theoretical discussion of our work given in [9]",

The registration framework was designed to simultaneously register two projection images to a 3D image volume. The projection geometry was set up to simulate the x-ray imaging system that attached to a medical linear accelerator for cancer treatment. The normalized correlation was used as the similarity measure and the Powell's optimizer was used as the optimization method. Siddon-Jacobs fast ray-tracing algorithm was implemented to compute projection images from a 3D image volume.",

   "abstract": "ITK is becoming increasingly complex as it continues to grow and evolve. The SimpleITK initiative aims to address this concern by providing an easy-access layer around ITK for non-C++ expert developers. This article proposes an alternate (perhaps complementary) approach utilizing the strategy pattern. The software design pattern known as \"strategy\" allows an algorithm to be selected from a family of algorithms on-the-fly at runtime. Because ITK consists of many such algorithm families, this particular design pattern is quite interesting. This article describes a number of algorithm families which have been identified; so far thirteen families have been implemented, encapsulating nearly 130 filters/objects. Complete source code and examples are provided to demonstrate the concept.",

This paper describes VTK classes for performing two functions: image interpolation via B-splines, and non-rigid coordinate transformation via B-splines. Special attention is paid to different boundary conditions for the ends of the spline: image interpolation supports clamped, mirrored, and repeated boundary conditions while B- spline grid transformations support clamped and zero-past-boundary conditions. The use of these classes for image deformation is demonstrated.",

We foresee our software useful for large scale evaluation studies of medical image segmentation and analysis software.",

These datasets were acquired using Synchrotron Radiation micro-Ct at the ESRF at a spatial resolution of 1.4 microns. The provided datasets were previously included in a study to develop\nnew 3D imaging methods to analyze, in three-dimensions, the morphology of microcracks\nhuman trabecular bone at the micrometric scale.\n\nThis paper is a pure data contribution. The datasets described here are made available in the public MIDAS database. Here we describe the content of the files to make easier for others to use this data as input for their own research work.

   "abstract": "This document describes an extension of the Insight Toolkit (ITK, www.itk.org) for 2D-3D registration with multiple fixed images, that is, registration of a three-dimensional dataset to a group of fixed planar projections. 2D-3D registration is possible with ITK's standard classes but with several limitations: the number of fixed images is restricted to one and the moving image's orientation axes are ignored, which greatly complicates the registration definition. Both problems are solved by the proposed framework, which permits multi-resolution intensity-based registration with an arbitrary number of fixed images, with all images defined in any orientation. In addition, the framework provides implementations of the Normalized Gradient Correlation and Pattern Intensity metrics, which are commonly used in 2D-3D registration but were not present in ITK. This article gives a detailed description of the proposed framework, along with examples that show its capabilities in registrations of real and simulated images of the spine.",

   "abstract": "There is great interest in the use of graphics processing units (GPU)for general purpose applications because the highly parallel architectures used in GPUs offer the potential for huge performance increases. The use of GPUs in image analysis applications has been under investigation for a number of years. This article describes modifications to the InsightToolkit (ITK) that provide a simple architecture for transparent use of GPU enabled filters and examples of how to write GPU enabled filters using the NVIDIA CUDA tools.\n\nThis work was performed between late 2009 and early 2010 and is being published as modifications to ITK 3.20. It is hoped that publication will help inform development of more general GPU support in ITK 4.0 and facilitate experimentation by users requiring functionality of 3.20 or wishing to pursue CUDA based developments.\n",

   "abstract": "This paper describes an integrated system for dental implantation including both preoperative planning utilizing computer-aided technology and automatic robot operation during the intra-operative stage. A novel two-step registration procedure was applied for transforming the preoperative plan to the operation of the robot, with the help of a Coordinate Measurement Machine (CMM). Experiments with a patient-specific phantom were carried out to evaluate the registration error for both position and orientation. After adopting several improvements, registration accuracy of the system was significantly improved. Sub-millimeter accuracy with the Target Registration Errors (TREs) of 0.38\u00b10.16 mm (N=5) was achieved. The target orientation errors after registration and after phantom drilling were 0.92\u00b10.16 \u00b0 (N=5) and 1.99\u00b11.27 \u00b0 (N=14), respectively. These results permit the ultimate goal of an automated robotic system for dental implantation.",

   "abstract": "Today, OR planning is supported by different clinical information systems. However, relevant patient information is distributed and spread over separate heterogeneous information systems (HIS, RIS, PACS), where each requires its own login and user interaction scheme. Furthermore, transfer of different planning data objects into the OR is currently not accomplished in a consistent electronic manner. This work proposes a framework, which integrates heterogeneous clinical information systems using a portal application with single-sign on and single-patient-lookup functionality. OR planning data can be composed into a digital planning record, which is seamlessly transferred to the modular integrated OR system. Data acquired or generated during surgery is automatically labeled with the electronic patient context, thus ensuring simple and consistent OR documentation.",

The original software architecture was a hierarchical one, based on the model-view-controller paradigm. To handle the growing number of devices, we introduce a new framework that facilitates the decomposition of system functionality into separate programs, as well as the data sharing between them. This allows us to integrate and test new functionality more quickly. Our work heavily utilizes the cisst libraries, developed by the Johns Hopkins University. In particular, we take advantage of cisst's multiprocess networking capabilities. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the integration of an eye-tracking based endoscope control.",

One solution to this problem is constraining the segmented area to only statistically possible shapes with the guidance of a shape model.

We describe how to create a 2d active shape model of articular femoral knee cartilage using ITK\u2019s ImagePCAShapeModelEstimator. Sample code and example images are provided for displaying the initial principle components of variation. Shape models built with our code can be used for segmentation with itk::GeodesicActiveContourShapePriorLevelSetImageFilter.",

   "abstract": "This paper presents the rationale for the use of a component-based architecture for computer-assisted intervention (CAI) systems, including the ability to reuse components and to easily develop distributed systems. We introduce three additional capabilities, however, that we believe are especially important for research and development of CAI systems. The first is the ability to deploy components among different processes (as conventionally done) or within the same process (for optimal real-time performance), without requiring source-level modifications to the component. This is particularly relevant for real-time video processing, where the use of multiple processes could cause perceptible delays in the video stream. The second key feature is the ability to dynamically reconfigure the system. In a system composed of multiple processes on multiple computers, this allows one process to be restarted (e.g., after correcting a problem) and reconnected to the rest of the system, which is more convenient than restarting the entire distributed application and enables better fault recovery. The third key feature is the availability of run-time tools for data collection, interactive control, and introspection, and offline tools for data analysis and playback. The above features are provided by the open-source cisst software package, which forms the basis for the Surgical Assistant Workstation (SAW) framework. A complex computer-assisted intervention system for retinal microsurgery is presented as an example that relies on these features. This system integrates robotics, stereo microscopy, force sensing, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging to transcend the current limitations of vitreoretinal surgery.\n",

   "abstract": "This paper presents the design of a tele-robotic microsurgical platform designed for development of cooperative and tele-operative control schemes, sensor based smart instruments, user interfaces and new surgical techniques with eye surgery as the driving application. The system is built using the distributed component-based cisst libraries and the Surgical Assistant Workstation framework. It includes a cooperatively controlled EyeRobot2, a da Vinci Master manipulator, and a remote stereo visualization system. We use constrained optimization based virtual fixture control to provide Virtual Remote-Center-of-Motion (vRCM) and haptic feedback. Such system can be used in a hybrid setup, combining local cooperative control with remote tele-operation, where an experienced surgeon can provide hand-over-hand tutoring to a novice user. In another scheme, the system can provide haptic feedback based on virtual fixtures constructed from real-time force and proximity sensor information.",

   "abstract": "Surgery simulation is a technology based on interactive biomechanics as well as haptic and visual rendering for training novice surgeons. Another important component of a surgery simulator is the representation of a patient's anatomy in terms of simple shapes, typically triangles and tetrahedra, coinciding with relevant tissues, whose manipulation, cutting and resection is simulated. While this technology has so far emphasized generic simulators, increasingly researchers are emphasizing models that derive from the images of patients whose pathology collectively are predictive of a significant proportion of the future caseload of surgeons. In addition, our philosophy of producing patient-specific neurosurgery simulators is to organize the architecture in terms of two parameters: the choice of approach- pterional, trans-nasal, frontal and so on, and the nature of the pathology, which in turn determines the specific nature of the treatment and choice of tools. This paper describes on-going work on the refinement of an open-source software pipeline for producing patient-specific neurosurgery simulation, based on segmentation tools such as those available in Slicer and BrainVisa, surface and volume meshing, such as public VTK-based tools and Tetgen respectively, and the SOFA simulation platform. Practical requirements of the various components of the pipeline, such as resolution control and fidelity of surface and volume meshing, and interactive nonlinear mechanics in the biomechanics engine, are discussed.",

   "abstract": "As robotic surgery gains popularity [1, 2, 3], methods for improving situational awareness during tele-\noperation have become an active area of research. Literature has attempted to incorporate haptic feedback\ndisplays to enhance and improve user performance. For example, Massimino et al. [4] showed that a combi-\nnation of vibrotactile and auditory substitutions lead to task performance (peg-in hole task) comparable to\nthat using a force feedback. Kitagawa et al. [5] extended this approach by using visual force displays and\nand auditory cues, in experiments showing comparable performance in surgical tasks (knot-tying). Reiley et\nal. [6] used a visual force display in a teleoperated knot-tying task to demonstrate lower forces and reduced\nsuture breakage by trainees.\nThe above art demonstrates the need for information overlays in telerobotic surgical tasks. However, this\nliterature also used prototype software and tools intended only for the speci\fc experiments. By contrast,\nwe use the Surgical Assistant Workstation (SAW) [7, 8] in development at Johns Hopkins University to\ncreate a general information overlay, and demonstrate its utility by creating a visual warning display for\ntelerobotic surgery that detects instruments being operated outside of the \feld of view of the endoscopic\ncamera. SAW is a modular framework for rapid prototyping of new tools and methods for robotic surgery. It\nincludes methods for image guidance, registration with pre-operative and intra-operative images, and ability\nto interact with the graphical objects rendered within the display with the master or slave manipulators in\na teleoperation environment.\nThe common telesurgical system in use is the da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical Inc.). It\nconsists of a surgeon's console containing the two master manipulators, a patient side cart with up to\nfour robotic arms - three for the slave instrument manipulators which can be equipped with the removable\ninstruments and an endoscope camera manipulator connected to a high-performance stereo vision system.\nThe da Vinci also provides a research and development application programming interface (DiMaio, et al.,\n[9]) that streams kinematics data and system events at con\fgurable rates of up to 100Hz. The SAW/cisst\nframework also contains an interface to the da Vinci API.\nWe present an overlay architecture (Figure 1) implemented using the cisst/SAW libraries to integrate\ncontextual procedure and system information for improving safety, and situational awareness during these\ndelicate and complex manipulations. While the presented methods can be modi\fed for use with any robotic\nsystem, we used our da Vinci S Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical Inc.) for the validation experiments\n(Figure 2) here. Results from validation experiments with 17 users and a total of 50 training sessions\ntotaling 214350 image frames are presented.",

   "abstract": "Purpose\nThe lack of interfaces for system integration in the Operating Room (OR) has been recognized as one of the major factors to impede efficient OR turnover procedures as well as efficient intraoperative data handling and ergonomics in the OR. A software interface for application-layer connection between data processing units in the OR is presented.\nMethods\nThe requirements for data exchange in the OR were derived, mostly from the literature. A c++ class library was developed according to these requirements. The efficiency of the data exchange and the limits of the system were investigated by a series of experiments. An examplary application was built using the library to show its applicability under realistic conditions.\nResults\nWe present the software library TiCoLi for automatic OR network configuration, device and service discovery (\"surgical plug-and-play\"), message exchange, data streaming, and remote access to device parameters and functionalities through an Ethernet network. The system is based on a modular, object-oriented software design, which guarantees high flexibility regarding the adaptation of its subsystems to the needs of a particular clinical application.\nConclusions\nThe TiCoLi package is the first open source software library which was developed for system integration in the OR which covers message exchange, data streaming, and auto configuration.",

   "abstract": "In this paper, we review the technical details of new features in OpenIGTLink version 2. OpenIGTLink is a free open-source network communication protocol designed for data exchange among devices and software. Since the first release of version 1.0 protocol along with a reference C/C++ library in 2008, the number of developers and users, who use OpenIGTLink in their research projects, have been growing among convincing some commercial companies to implement research interface based on OpenIGTLink their commercial products. However, the message types initially defined for research prototypes does not cover some of functionality in commercial products, thus the protocol needed to be requires refinement in the protocol. The goal of the extension in version 2 is to support such new demands emerged after the release of the initial version, while keeping the protocol as simple as possible. The version 2 protocol has been implemented as an extension of version 1; it is backward compatible in the sense that messages generated by OpenIGTLink version 2 compliant software can be received by version 1 compliant software.

   "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nBrain tissue segmentation is important in many medical image applications. We augmented the Expectation-Maximization segmentation algorithm in Slicer3 (www.spl.harvard.edu) . Currently, in the EM Segmenter module in Slicer3 user input is necessary to set tissue-class (Gray Matter, White Matter etc.) intensity values. Our contribution to the current pipeline is to automatically compute such values using k-means clustering. Our method can be applied to scans of varying intensity profiles and thus we obviate the need for a normalization step. We applied this pipeline on multiple datasets and our method was able to accurately classify tissue-classes. The implementation was done as a standalone utility in the Python programming language (www.python.org) and work is underway to incorporate it in the EM processing pipeline. ",

   "abstract": "Ultrasound imaging is the most popular and safe diagnostic medical imaging modality. Over the past years, a considerable number of studies have been conducted on new medical ultrasound imaging modalities such as ultrasound-based elasticity imaging, photoacoustic imaging, thermal imaging, etc. Moreover, results of such advanced ultrasound research are readily integrated with Image Guided Therapy (IGT) systems due to the advantages of ultrasound imaging such as mobility and real-time data acquisition. For integrating two systems, a communication method between systems has to be devised. OpenIGTLink is a standardized TCP/IP-based protocol for the integration of medical imaging and IGT systems. However, OpenIGTLink is not sufficient for communicating between IGT and advanced ultrasound research systems, because OpenIGTLink does not define any message type for general ultrasound data and some results of ultrasound researching.\nIn this paper, we propose an extension to OpenIGTLink, called OpenIGTLinkMUSiiC, by adding new message types and new network classes. Our new message types are designed for containing raw ultrasound data, advanced ultrasound modalities, and text-based control parameters. The network classes of OpenIGTLinkMUSiiC improve upon the performance of existing network classes by implementing a multithread architecture. Finally, we present two ultrasound research applications using OpenIGTLink-MUSiiC.\n",

   "abstract": "The Hausdorff distance is a measure of the distance between sets of points. There are many advantages to using this metric compared to other similarity measures. This document describes a VTK class for computing the Hausdorff Distance between two sets of points. The main contribution, compared to other implementations, lies in the definition of the distance not only to the closest point but to the closest point in the represented surface, which yields an accurate measure even between undersampled surfaces. This is achieved by implementing a point-to-cell distance instead of a point-to-point. Furthermore, a plugin for ParaView was implemented, which is also available with the code. After introducing the interest of this distance, the VTK code is explained and illustrated with some examples.",

   "abstract": "This document describes the implementation in ITK of the \"point in circle\" geometrical predicate.\nBased on Jonathan Shewchuk's work which implements an exact version of the predicate using standard\nfloating point types and arithmetic, the implementation consist of an ITK wrapper around the \npublic domain C routines made available by the author of the precedent paper.\nWrapper using itk::PointSet, itk:CellInterface and itk:Mesh / itk:QuadEdgeMesh APIs are provided\nalong with corresponding examples which should provide enough details for users to directly\ncopy paste code in their application.\n\nThe application in mind for us is an exact and robust implementation of a delaunay triangulation /\nvoronoi tesselation in ITK, and will be presented in a separate paper.",

   "abstract": "This document presents a new class to apply an itkImageFunction to every pixel in an itkImage. This functionality is almost identical to itkUnaryFunctorImageFilter, but it uses an itkImageFunction rather than an itk::Functor. As some functionalities in ITK seem to have been implemented as image functors (itk::Functor::AND, itk::Functor::Atan, etc.) while other seems to have been implemented as itkImageFunction's (itk::BinaryThresholdImageFunction, itk::CentralDifferenceImageFunction, etc.), it seems reasonable to be able to apply any of these operations to an entire image.\n\nThe code is available here: http://review.source.kitware.com/#change,2008",

   "abstract": "In this document we present the implementation of three fuzzy clustering algorithms using the Insight Toolkit ITK. Firstly, we developed the conventional Fuzzy C-Means that will serve as the basis for the rest of the proposed algorithms. The next algorithms are the FCM with spatial constraints based on kernel-induced distance and the Modified Spatial Kernelized Fuzzy C-Means. Both of these introduce a Kernel function, replacing the Euclidean distance of the FCM, and spatial information into the membership function.\n\nThese algorithms have been implemented in a threaded version to take advantage of the multicore processors. Moreover, providing an useful implementation make it possible that classes work with 2D/3D images, different kernels and spatial shapes.\n\nWe included the source code as well as different 2D/3D examples, using several input parameters for the algorithms and obtaining the results generated on 2D/3D CT lung studies.",

   "abstract": "We have implemented filters for computing phase symmetry (PS) in ITK using steerable filters computed and applied in the Fourier domain. In some recent publications, phase symmetry has been shown to be a useful pre-processing measure for performing image registration and segmentation. Matlab implementations of the code are currently available, but may be slower than C++ versions and most importantly, do not work with volumetric (3D) data. In this paper we briefly provide background information and list some applications of PS filters from the literature. We then provide instructions and examples of how to use the classes and executables.",

   "abstract": "The recent ITKv4 refactoring includes several enhancements to the existing registration framework. These additional transform classes provide access to mappings described by dense displacement fields and their corresponding optimization which complement the popular free-form deformation (FFD) ap- proach already in ITK. Innovation motivated by previous work [5] and recent diffeomorphic image regis- tration developments in which the characteristic velocity field is represented by spatiotemporal B-splines [2], resulted in a diffeomorphic B-spline-based image registration algorithm combining and extending these techniques which we make available in ITK through the gerrit system. Additionally, we include two command line tools showcasing the new elements of the registration refactoring for 1) computing mappings between two images (antsRegistration) including the family of transforms discussed in this article and 2) applying those transformations to images (antsApplyTransforms). NB: The user must download the patch available at http://review.source.kitware.com/#/c/3606/ in or- der to compile the code accompanying this article.",

We plan to do that but haven\\'t yet as we have other priorities with respect to the contract that is funding this work.  Even our pairwise velocity field work continues to be refined (e.g.  http://review.source.kitware.com/#/c/7080/).  Perhaps we can communicate with you in the future regarding this request.\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nNick",

We believe this will broaden the use of ParaView for high performance computing and visualization in the medical imaging research community. The effort is focused on developing ParaView plug-ins for managing VTK structures from 3D Slicer MRML scenes and encapsulating ITK filters for deployment in ParaView. In this paper, we present KWScene, an open source cross-platform library that is being developed to support implementation of these types of plugins. We describe the overall design of the library and provide implementation details and conclude by presenting a concrete example that demonstrates the use of the KWScene library in computational anatomy research at Johns Hopkins Center for Imaging Science.",

   "abstract": "This paper describes the implementation of the LDFFD and TDFFD algorithms. Both quantify motion and deformation from an input image sequence by taking profit of the temporal dimension of velocity fields in the diffeomorphic registration framework to process the input image sequence as a single 3D+t object. The rationale behind these approaches is to formulate motion estimation in an image sequence as a multi-channel registration problem. This paper describes our implementation, currently following the original ITK registration framework without multi-threading and diffeomorphic registration framework.\nMigration to ITKv4 will be addressed in future work. We also provide code for computing strain on a segmentation represented as a VTK polydata mesh. Program usages for LDFFD and TDFFD as well as strain quantification results are given for one 3D ultrasound image sequence acquired on a healthy volunteer.",

SACAI workshop aims to establish a forum for discussing systems and architectures for computer assisted discussing intervention (CAI) applications. Continuing the success of the series, the workshop will focus on open interfaces, interoperability, and standards. In addition, this year, we will discuss clinical applications and future directions of CAI systems and frameworks.

   "abstract": "Acquiring data sets for stereo or multi-view reconstruction with known ground truth is costly and time consuming. Freely available data sets mostly focus on specific scene conditions and might not reflect the intended application scenario. We propose a GPU accelerated ray tracing framework that allows to generate realistic images with adjustable camera properties and projection geometry. Due to the nature of ray tracing, ground truth data can easily be obtained. The system also supports projectors as used e.g. for structured light systems. This facilitates to study interaction effects between different pattern designs, camera and projector properties, as well as the utilized reconstruction algorithm.",

   "abstract": "We present preliminary results of our work to develop an augmented display for improved visualization\nof the prostate and surrounding critical anatomy for robot-assisted prostate surgery. Prostate\ncancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men in the United States. Early stage\nprostate cancer is potentially cured by surgery, which can be performed in a traditional, open fashion\nor laparoscopically. Recently, robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) using the da\nVinci surgical robot system has gained wide acceptance. Robotic systems improve surgeon dexterity\nby incorporating additional degrees of freedom at the end of the tools and offer increased precision\nand stability of movements. However, since the procedure is performed through small incisions, this\ntechnique reduces free sight and tactile feedback compared to open surgery. Surgeons also lose the ability\nto palpate the prostate to locate tumors and other critical structures such as neurovascular bundles\n(NVB). Surgeons must rely on visual cues from the video monitor and mentally correlate them with\nthe underlying anatomy, often using information from medical images obtained prior to the procedure.\nFurther complications arise from local deformations in the prostate tissue that occurs throughout the\nprostatectomy procedure due to the interaction between the surgical instruments and the prostate tissue.\nSubsequently, the anatomical model generated pre-operatively will need to be updated during the procedure\nto reflect this deformation. To address the clinical need for more accurate and reliable guidance,\nwe are developing a navigation system that provides surgeons with an augmented reality (AR) view that\nfuses a pre-operative MRI model of the prostate, tumor and surrounding tissues with the da Vinci system\nlaparoscopic video, while compensating for non-rigid prostate tissue deformation using intra-operative\ntransrectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging. The work focuses on three components: (i) Developing and\nevaluating algorithm for registration of MRI and ultrasound images (2) Building and testing an augmented\nreality, with 3D Slicer, Surgical Assistant Workstation (SAW) and the da Vinci surgical robotic\nsystem. (3) Evaluate the system using a multi-modality prostate phantom.",

   "abstract": "This paper describes the Statismo framework, which is a framework for PCA based statistical models.Statistical models are used to describe the variability of an object within a population, learned from a set of training samples. Originally developed to model shapes, statistical models are now increasingly used to model the variation in different kind of data, such as for example images, volumetric meshes or deformation fields. Statismo has been developed with the following main goals in mind: \n1) To provide generic tools for learning different kinds of PCA based statistical models, such as shape, appearance or deformations models. \n2) To make the exchange of such models easier among different research groups and to improve the reproducibility of the models. \n3) To allow for easy integration of new methods for model building into the framework. \nTo achieve the first goal, we have abstracted all the aspects that are specific to a given model and data representation, into a user defined class. This does not only make it possible to use Statismo to create different kinds of PCA models, but also allows Statismo to be used with any toolkit and data format. To facilitate data exchange, Statismo defines a storage format based on HDF5, which includes all the information necessary to use the model, as well as meta-data about the model creation, which helps to make model building reproducible. The last goal is achieved by providing a clear separation between data management, model building and model representation. In addition to the standard method for building PCA models, Statismo already includes two recently proposed algorithms for building conditional models, as well as convenience tools for facilitating cross-validation studies.\nAlthough Statismo has been designed to be independent of a particular toolkit, special efforts have been made to make it directly useful for VTK and ITK. Besides supporting model building for most data representations used by VTK and ITK, it also provides an ITK transform class, which allows for the integration of Statismo with the ITK registration framework. This leverages the efforts from the ITK project to readily access powerful methods for model fitting.",

   "abstract": "Ultrasound (US) imaging is a popular and convenient medical imaging modality thanks to its mobility, non-ionizing radiation, ease-of-use, and real-time acquisition. Conventional US imaging is frequently integrated with tracking systems and robotic systems in Image Guided Therapy (IGT) systems. Recently, these systems are also incorporating advanced US imaging such as US elasticity imaging, photoacoustic imaging, and thermal imaging. Real-time synchronous data from multiple sources and bidirectional data communication are essential for integrating components in advanced US IGT research. We previously proposed the MUSiiC ToolKit [1], a modular real-time software toolkit, and OpenIGTLinkMUSiiC [2], a standard communication protocol extended from the OpenIGTLink library [3, 4]. However, this software framework only supported real-time synchronous data from at most two sources and unidirectional communication at the software module level and class level.\n\nIn this paper, we propose MUSiiC ToolKit 2.0, an upgraded software framework for interventional advanced US research sup-porting bidirectional communication, real-time US data processing, and real-time data synchronization from multiple sources. MUSiiC ToolKit 2.0 consists of OpenIGTLink 2.0, OpenIGTlinkMUSiiC 2.0, MUSiiCNotes 2.0, and a collection of executable programs designed for US research. OpenIGTLink 2.0 is a standard TCP/IP-based protocol for the integration of medical imaging and IGT systems. OpenIGTLinkMUSiiC 2.0 is the upgraded version of OpenIGTLinkMUSiiC with new active multi-task classes, data interfaces for supporting bidirectional communication and parallel data processing. MUSiiCNotes 2.0 provides US research-oriented task classes, such as US data acquisition, beamforming, envelope detection, scan conversion, and data synchronization. Graphic User Interface (GUI) units are also available for the executable programs in MUSiiCNotes 2.0. Finally, we introduce advanced US applications based on this new software framework. \n",

   "abstract": "Modern medical imaging analyses often involve the concatenation of multiple steps, and neuroimaging analysis is no exception. The Java Image Science Toolkit (JIST) has provided a framework for both end users and engineers to synthesize processing modules into tailored, automatic multi-step processing pipelines (\u201clayouts\u201d) and rapid prototyping of module development. Since its release, JIST has facilitated substantial neuroimaging research and fulfilled much of its intended goal. However, key weaknesses must be addressed for JIST to more fully realize its potential and become accessible to an even broader community base. Herein, we identify three core challenges facing traditional JIST (JIST-I) and present the solutions in the next generation JIST (JIST-II). First, in response to community demand, we have introduced seamless data visualization; users can now click \u2018show this data\u2019 through the program interfaces and avoid the need to locating files on the disk. Second, as JIST is an open-source community effort by-design; any developer may add modules to the distribution and extend existing functionality for release. However, the large number of developers and different use cases introduced instability into the overall JIST-I framework, causing users to freeze on different, incompatible versions of JIST-I, and the JIST community began to fracture. JIST-II addresses the problem of compilation instability by performing continuous integration checks nightly to ensure community implemented changes do not negatively impact overall JIST-II functionality. Third, JIST-II allows developers and users to ensure that functionality is preserved by running functionality checks nightly using the continuous integration framework. With JIST-II, users can submit layout test cases and quality control criteria through a new GUI. These test cases capture all runtime parameters and help to ensure that the module produces results within tolerance, despite changes in the underlying architecture. These three \u201cnext generation\u201d improvements increase the fidelity of the JIST framework and enhance utility by allowing researchers to more seamlessly and robustly build, manage, and understand medical image analysis processing pipelines.",

   "abstract": "As part of the ITK v4 project efforts, we have developed ITK filters for physics-based non-rigid registration (PBNRR), which satisfies the following requirements: account for tissue properties in the registration, improve accuracy compared to rigid registration, and reduce execution time using GPU and multi-core accelerators. The implementation has three main components: (1) Feature Point Selection, (2) Block Matching (mapped to both multi-core and GPU processors), and (3) a Robust Finite Element Solver. The use of multi-core and GPU accelerators in ITK v4 provides substantial performance improvements. For example, in average for the non-rigid registration of brain MRIs, the performance of the Block Matching filter is about 12 times faster when 12 hyperthreaded multi-cores are used and about 540 times faster when the Quadro 6000 with 448 threads is used in Dell Workstation.",

   "abstract": "Intensity inhomogeneities often occur in medical images, especially when using magnetic resonance imaging. In these images, the standard Chan-and-Vese levelset segmentation method may not work properly, as it assumes constant intensity distributions for foreground and background. Recently, a novel method was published that models the intensities as piece-wise smooth, and thus is more suitable to segment images with intensity homogeneities. However, this method was not yet implemented in ITK. This submission introduces our implementation of the region-scalable-fitting levelset segmentation method within the ITKv4 levelset framework.\n",

While this programming model is memory efficient, it places most of the implementation burden on the user. We provide an implementation of the Document Object Model (DOM) framework for parsing XML documents. Using this model, user code is greatly simplified, shifting most of the implementation burden from the user to the framework. \nThe provided implementation consists of two tiers. The lower level tier provides functionality for parsing XML documents and loading the tree structure into memory. It then allows the user to query and retrieve specific entries. The upper tier uses this functionality to provide an interface for mimicking a serialization and de-serialization mechanism for ITK objects. The implementation described in this document was incorporated into ITK as part of release 4.2.",

Unfortunately, the Visualization Toolkit does not offer these features, and so in this paper a modified vtkGPUVolumeRayCastMapper is presented.

   "abstract": "We implemented the shape-based interpolation method described by Raya and Udupa in 1990 for three-dimensional images, and created two standalone filters using the Insight Toolkit ITK. The image to be interpolated must be a 3D binary image which represents an object as a series of 2D slices with pixel values at 1 inside the object and 0 outside by convention. The first filter takes as input a 3D binary image wherein the object of interest is represented in full, that is, on all contiguous slices that comprise it. Such filter yields an upsampled 3D binary image. The second filter takes as input a 3D binary image wherein the object of interest is represented only on certain slices that are regularly spaced. It yields a 3D binary image of the same size as that of the input and wherein the object is represented on all contiguous slices that comprise it. This paper is provided with the source code as well as the data used for validation.",

   "abstract": "This document describes a plug-in for Blender (www.blender.org) that allows to rasterize 3D mesh objects into 3D voxel data, i. e. it allows to voxelize Blender meshes. In 2D, this process can be compared to rasterization of vector graphics into pixel graphics. The voxelization is done by VTK (www.vtk.org) functions. A simple GUI allows to choose the type of voxelization and to specify necessary parameters. Depending on the type chosen, only the surface of the mesh objects is voxelized or the enclosed volume, i. e.\u201cfilled\u201d. Beside the size of the output, one can specify if the result should be \u201canti-aliased\u201d or not.\nThis paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and output data that the authors used for validating the script described in this paper.\n",

This paper describe in particular the data structure, an extension of itk::QuadEdgeMesh, a filter to compute and add to the the structure the dual of an existing mesh, and an adaptor which let a down- ward pipeline process the dual mesh as if it was a native itk::QuadEdgeMesh. The new data structure, itk::QuadEdgeMeshWithDual, is an extension of the already existing itk::QuadEdgeMesh, which already included by default the due topology, to handle dual geometry as well. Two types of primal meshes have been specifically illustrated: triangular / simplex meshes and Voronoi / Delaunay. A functor mechanism has been implemented to allow for different kind of computation of the dual geometry. This paper is accompanied with the source code and examples.",

In this report we explore acceleration of two time-consuming parts of a registration algorithm by means of parallel processing using the GPU. We built upon the OpenCL-based GPU image processing framework of the recent ITK4 release, and implemented Gaussian multi-resolution strategies and a general resampling framework. We evaluated the performance gain on two multi-core machines with NVidia GPUs, and compared to an existing ITK4 CPU implementation. A speedup factor of ~2-4 was realized for the multi-resolution strategies and a speedup factor of ~10-46 was achieved for resampling, for larger images (~10^8 voxels).",

I think this is essential for reliable use of itk filters in loops. The BinaryDilateFilter may be a mini pipeline filter and thus do the same thing internally.\r\n\r\n2) The label filters (and the parabolic filters from which they were derived) shouldn\\'t need to be run iteratively. If you want a large dilation then simply supply a large radius. This approach is much faster and will give the correct result. The problem with the iterative approach is you tend to end up with dilations that are compositions of little rectangles and are thus like a big rectangle. If you really want a dilation by a circle (which is usually the case) then use a large radius. The tests I\\'ve added show the difference between the two cases - check out looplabdilate2d.png and looplabdilate2d50.png.\r\n\r\nIf you still see problems with this test example then it may be a platform difference - I\\'ve only tested this code on linux and mac.",

It is just that the binary ball structuring element is different to the structuring element that gets used in the label dilate code. The binary ball is a bresenham circle. The label dilate code uses distance transforms internally. For a specified radius the bresenham circle is a bit bigger - a voxel that has any part less than the radius will get included in the bresenham circle. The version based on distance transforms is looking at the voxel centre - voxel centre needs to be closer than the specified radius. You can see the difference in your example if you set the iterations to 1. Neither of them do a great job of representing small spheres - thats not something that can be avoided - and the label dilate version is a little smaller. The difference grows with loop iterations.\r\n\r\nHowever there isn\\'t any need to use iterative approaches to construct a large sphere with the label code. Just use a large radius and you\\'ll get a good circle/sphere very quickly. The bianry dilate probably won\\'t be as fast. If you aren\\'t really interested in preserving labels  then check out the parabolicMorphology package also on github. Note that it assumes images with 0/1 values.",

The first pass sets the mask to a value that defines the size of the dilation - hence only the first element of the radius has any effect.\r\n\r\nIt is probably feasible to incorporate a weighting via the image spacing term - do you think this is an important capability?

Such systems can help to overcome shortcomings of the individual techniques or create new kinds of possible use cases. To ease the development of a hybrid modality we have created a generic, portable, lightweight, and easily extensible, client-server based framework, implemented in C++, to control the communication between multiple imaging and tracking devices. Our framework Computer Aided Medical Procedures Communication (CAMPCom), allows developers of hybrid systems to focus on the most important implementation aspects by freeing them from the more generic tasks of data serialization and exchange.

   "abstract": "We present our work to develop a telerobotics research platform that provides complete access to all levels of control via open-source custom electronics and software. The electronics employs an FPGA to enable a centralized computation and distributed I/O architecture in which all control computations are implemented in a familiar development environment (Linux PC) and low-latency I/O is performed over an IEEE-1394a (Firewire) bus at speeds up to 400 Mbits/sec. The mechanical components of the system are provided by the Research Kit for the da Vinci System, which consists of the Master Tool Manipulators (MTMs), Patient Side Manipulators (PSMs), and stereo console of the first-generation da Vinci surgical robot. This system is currently installed, or planned for installation, at 11 research institutions, with additional installations likely in the future, thereby creating a research community around a common open-source hardware and software platform.",

   "abstract": "This paper is about a design policy for operation-room (OR) friendly research system, software and a software toolkit SCCToolKit for this purpose, and a few examples. Examples are image processor for endoscope, OR event detector, vision based registration of ultrasound and endoscopic images, etc. We name the design policy as Small Computations for Clinicals (SCC). A system is SCC savvy if it is 1) single purpose, 2) turn-key system without need of using mouse and keyboard, 3) small form factor PC based, and 4) cost less than $1,000 USD. SCCToolKit is OpenCV extension that could minimize the number of buffer copies from receiving image frames from operating system to render it to display buffer. It is open source under BSD license. We measured the latency of image capture to display of the endoscope image processor was between 0.13 to 0.2 second for 1920x1080 size display with chroma-key image mixing. Considering of the acceptable latency of 0.2 second, the performance was as good as commercially available, custom hardware processor that could cost over 10,000 USD, while our PC based system cost 773 USD.",

Transapical aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a recently developed surgical technique to treat severe aortic valve stenosis in elderly and high-risk patients. The placement of stented aortic valve prosthesis is crucial and typically performed under live 2-D fluoroscopy guidance. To assist the placement of the prosthesis during the surgical procedure, a few image-guided TAVI systems have been developed. This work therefore presents current difficulties and challenges of these guidance systems, with consideration of future prospects.",

   "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a new concept of surgical navigation which processes information interactively between the real and virtual spaces, namely, updating preoperative images using the positional information of surgical tools. Although the organs are deformed by operative procedures during surgery, surgical navigation systems usually do not change the reference images that are taken prior to surgery. It is useful to generate deformed reference images during surgery while it progresses. We develop a skull base surgery navigation system that updates the preoperative images during surgery. To estimate the resected regions, our proposed system utilizes the positional information of the surgical tools that can be tracked by a surgical navigation system. Our proposed system reflects the bone removal on preoperative images by changing the voxel values of the preoperative images using the positional information of the tracked tools. The updated reference images are generated by visualizing the updated preoperative images using a volume rendering method. We evaluated the proposed system on a skull phantom created from CT images by a 3D printer. The experimental results showed that the proposed system updated the reference images in real time based on the surgical tasks including bone removal process. The accuracy of our proposed method was about 1 mm. It is very useful for surgeons to drill into such complex bone structure as the skull base.",

   "abstract": "In this paper we applied one of our regularly used processing pipelines for fully automated brain tissue segmentation. Brain tissue was segmented in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM). Our algorithms for skull stripping, tissue segmentation and white matter lesion (WML) detection were slightly adapted and applied to twelve data sets within the MRBrainS13 brain tissue segmentation challenge. Skull stripping is performed using non-rigid registration of 5 atlas masks. Our tissue segmentation is based on an automatically trained kNN-classifier. Training samples were obtained by non-rigid registration of 5 manually labeled scans followed by a pruning step in feature space to remove any residual erroneously sampled tissue voxels. The kNN-classification incorporates voxel intensities from a T1-weighted scan and a FLAIR scan. The white matter lesion detection is based on an automatically determined threshold on the FLAIR scan. The application of the algorithms on the data from the MRBrainS13 Challenge showed that our pipeline produces acceptable segmentations. Average resulting Dice scores were 77.86 (CSF), 81.22 (GM), 87.27 (WM), 93.78 (total parenchyma), and 96.26 (all intracranial structures). Total processing time was about 2 hours per subject.",

   "abstract": "This study investigates a method for brain tissue segmentation from 3D T1 weighted (T1w) MR images via convex relaxation with a hierarchical ordering constraint. It employs a multi-atlas-based initialization from 5 training images and is tested on 12 T1w MR images provided by the MICCAI 2013 MRBrainS segmentation challenge. The registered atlas images, fully segmented into eight different brain structures, are used to formulate shape and intensity priors for a Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) energy that is subsequently minimized with a dual hierarchical max-flow computation. The algorithm makes use of a hierarchical label ordering constraint to regularize label families individually and its inherently globally optimal results guarantee robust segmentations. Major parts of the image processing pipeline are implemented using General-Purpose Programming on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU) for a substantial increase in computation speed.",

   "abstract": " A fully automatic brain segmentation method is presented. First the skull is stripped using a model-based level set on T1-weighted inversion recovery images, then the brain ventricles and basal ganglia are segmented using the same method on T1-weighted images. The central white matter is segmented using a regular level set method but with high curvature regulation. To segment the cortical gray matter, a skeleton-based model is created by extracting the mid-surface of the gray matter from a preliminary segmentation using a threshold-based level set. An implicit model is then built by defining the thickness of the gray matter to be 2.7 mm. This model is incorporated into the level set framework and used to guide a second round more precise segmentation. Preliminary experiments show that the proposed method can provide relatively accurate results compared with the segmentation done by human observers. The processing time is considerably shorter than most conventional automatic brain segmentation methods. ",

   "abstract": "We propose a new MAP-based technique for the unsupervised segmentation of different brain structures (white matter, gray matter, etc.) from T1-weighted MR brain images. In this paper, we follow a procedure like most conventional approaches, in which T1-weighted MR brain images and desired maps of regions (white matter, gray matter, etc.) are modeled by a joint Markov-Gibbs Random Field model (MGRF) of independent image signals and interdependent region labels. However, we specifically focus on the most accurate model identification that can be achieved. The proposed joint MGRF model accounts for the following three descriptors: i) a 1st-order visual appearance descriptor(empirical distribution of signal intensity), ii) a 3D probabilistic shape prior, and iii) a 3D spatially invariant 2nd-order homogeneity descriptor. To better specify the 1st-order visual appearance descriptor, each empirical distribution of signals is precisely approximated by a Linear Combination of Discrete Gaussians (LCDG) having both positive and negative components. The 3D probabilistic shape prior is learned using a subset of 3D co-aligned training T1-weighted MR brain images. The 2nd-order homogeneity descriptor is modeled by a 2nd-order translation and rotation invariant MGRF of 3D T1-weighted MR brain region labels with analytically estimated potentials. The initial segmentation, based on a 1st-order visual appearance and 3D probabilistic shape, is then iteratively refined using a 3D MGRF model with analytically estimated potentials. Experiments on twelve 3D T1-weighted MR brain images confirm the high accuracy of the proposed approach.",

   "abstract": "Segmentation of the human cerebrum from magnetic resonance images (MRI) into its component tissues has been a defining problem in medical imaging. Until recently, this has been solved as the tissue classification of the T1-weighted (T1-w) MRI, with numerous solutions for this problem having appeared in the literature. The clinical demands of understanding lesions, which are indistinguishable from gray matter in T1-w images, has necessitated the incorporation of T2-weighted Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) images to improve segmentation of the cerebrum. Many of the existing methods fail to handle the second data channel gracefully, because of assumptions about their model. In our new approach, we explore a model free algorithm which uses a classification technique based on ensembles of decision trees to learn the mapping from an image feature to the corresponding tissue label. We use corresponding image patches from a registered set of T1-w and FLAIR images with a manual segmentation to construct our decision\ntree ensembles. Our method is \u000eefficient, taking less than two minutes on a 240x240x48 volume. We conduct experiments on five training sets in a leave-one-out fashion, as well as validation on an additional twelve subjects, and a landmark validation experiment on another cohort of five\nsubjects.",

Intensity-model based classification of MR images has proven problematic. The statistical approach does not carry any spatial, textural and neighborhood information in it. We propose to use a computationally fast and novel feature-set to facilitate voxel wise classification based on regional intensity, texture, spatial location of voxels in addition to posterior probability estimates. Information available through T1-weighted (T1), T1-weighted inversion recovery (IR) and T2-weighted FLAIR (FLAIR) MRI sequences was also leveraged. An aggregate overlap of 90.21% for all intracranial structures was reported between the automatic classification and available expert annotation as measured by the DICE coefficient.",

The standard Gaussian Mixture Model is the most widely used method for MR Brain Image Segmentation and Expectation Maximization algorithm is used to estimate the model parameters. The Gaussian Mixture Model considers each pixel as independent and does not take into account the spatial correlation between the neighbouring pixels. Hence the segmentation result obtained using standard GMM is highly sensitive to Inensity Non-Uniformity and noise. The image is divided into blocks before applying EM since the GMM is preserved in the local image blocks. Also, Nonsubsampled Contourlet Transform is employed to incorporate the spatial correlation among the neighbouring pixels. The method is applied to the 12 MR Brain volumes of MRBRAINS13 test data and the White Matter, Gray Matter and CSF structures were segmented.",

   "abstract": "In this paper, we validate our proposed segmentation algorithm called Bayesian-based adaptive mean-shift (BAMS) on real mul-timodal MR images provided by the MRBrainS challenge. BAMS is a fully automatic unsupervised segmentation algorithm. It is based on the adaptive mean shift wherein the adaptive bandwidth of the kernel for each feature point is estimated using our proposed Bayesian approach [1]. BAMS is designed to segment the brain into three tissues; white matter (WM), gray matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The performance of the algorithm is evaluated relative to the manual segmentation (ground truth). The results of our proposed algorithm show the average Dice index 0.8377\u00b10.036 for the WM, 0.7637\u00b10.038 for the GM and 0.6835 \u00b10.023 for the CSF.",

   "abstract": "Characterization of anatomical structure of the brain and effi\fcient algorithms for automatically analyzing brain MRI have gained an increasing interest in recent years. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that automatically segments the anatomical structures of magnetic resonance human brain images. Our method uses the prior knowledge of labels given by experts to statistically investigate the spatial correspondences of brain structures in subject images. We create a multi-atlas by registering the training images to the subject image and then propagating corresponding labels to the graph of the image. Label fusion then combines these multiple labels of atlases into one label at each voxel with intensity similarity based weighted voting. Finally we cluster the graph using multiway cut in order to achieve the fi\fnal 3D segmentation of the subject image. The promising evaluation results of our segmentation method on the MRBrainS13 Test Dataset shows the effi\u000eciency and robustness of our algorithm.",

   "abstract": "In this article, we present an implementation of a flexible framework for non-parametric variational image registration, realized as part of ITK's finite difference solver hierarchy.\n\nIn a variational registration setting, the transformation is found by minimizing an energy functional that consists of (at least) two terms: a distance measure between fixed and transformed moving image and a smoothness condition for the transformation. The specific choice of these terms depends on the particular application and requires consideration of, for example, image content and imaging modalities. Following this view, the presented framework can be seen as a generalization of the demons algorithm in which two key aspects remain exchangeable: the force term (or registration function, according to the distance measure) and the regularizer (according to the smoothness condition). Moreover, two transformation models are realized: either a dense displacement field or a stationary velocity field to restrain the transformation to the space of diffeomorphisms.\n\nIn its current state, the framework includes implementations of forces based on the Sum of Squared Differences (SSD), Normalized Cross Correlation (NCC) and the demons algorithm as well as Gaussian, diffusion and elastic smoothing. However, the implementation of further components is possible and encouraged.\n",

   "abstract": "In order to guaranty performances of complex systems using numerical simulation, CEA is performing advanced data analysis and scientific visualization with open source software using High Performance Computing (HPC) capability. The diversity of the physics to study produces results of growing complexity in terms of large-scale, high dimensional and multivariate data. Moreover, the HPC approach introduces another layer of complexity by allowing computation amongst thousands of remote cores accessed from sites located hundreds of kilometers away from the computing facility.\nThis paper presents how CEA deploys and contributes to open source software to enable production class visualization tools in a high performance computing context. Among several open source projects used at CEA, this presentation will focus on Visit, VTK and Paraview.\nIn the first part we will address specific issues encountered when deploying VisIt and Paraview in a multi-site supercomputing facility for end-users. Several examples will be given on how such tools can be adapted to take advantage of a parallel setting to explore large multi-block dataset or perform remote visualization on material interface reconstructions of billions of cells. Then, the specific challenges faced to deliver Paraview\u2019s Catalyst capabilities to end-users will be discussed.\nIn the second part, we will describe how CEA contributes to open source visualization software and associated software development strategy by emphasizing on two recent development projects. The first is an integrated simulation workbench providing plugins for every step required to achieve numerical simulation independently on a local or a remote computer. Embedded in an Eclipse RCP environment, VTK views allow the users to perform data input using interaction or mesh preview before running the simulation code. Contributions to VTK have been made in order to smoothly integrate these technologies. The second details how recent developments at CEA have helped to visualize and to analyze results from ExaStamp, a parallel molecular dynamics simulation code dealing with molecular systems ranging from a few millions up to a billion atoms. These developments include a GPU intensive rendering method specialized for atoms and specific parallel algorithms to process molecular data sets.",

We introduce a new method for the automatic segmentation of parotid glands that extends existing patch-based approaches in three ways: (1) we promote the use of image features in combination with patch intensity values to increase discrimination; (2) we work with larger search windows than established methods by using an approximate nearest neighbor search; and (3) we demonstrate that location information is a crucial discriminator and add it explicitly to the description. In our experiments, we compare a large number of features and introduce a new multi-scale descriptor. The best performance is achieved with entropy image features in combination with patches and location information.",

   "abstract": "Real-time 3D echocardiography has already been shown to be an accurate tool for left ventricular (LV) volume assessment. However, LV border identification remains a challenging task, mainly because of the low contrast of the images combined with drop-out artifacts. Many (semi-)automatic algorithms have been proposed to segment the LV border, but a systematic and fair comparison between such methods has so far been impossible due to a lack of publicly available common database. The aim of this MICCAI challenge was to gather researchers around the field of LV segmentation in 3D cardiac ultrasound by providing a common database to compare algorithms directly. The proposed platform will allow a consistent evaluation and ranking of the current state-of-the-art segmentation solutions and will contribute to a faster clinical translation of groundbreaking technical advances. The purpose of this paper is to describe the technical aspects of the generation of the database, give an overview of the ranking strategy and the outline of the challenge itself.",

   "abstract": "Within the framework of the CETUS challenge, forty-five 3D echocardiographic datasets have been acquired and segmented independently by three clinical experts from different hospitals. The goal was to generate a well-established ground truth of validated expert contours on this broad range of images from different ultrasound vendors, for a number of common pathologies. Image data were acquired and segmented according to a specifically designed protocol. Since there is no clear standard or guideline for segmentation for 3DUS, we defined a tracing consensus which results in clinically acceptable and reproducible contours. Tracing was performed in four longitudinal and five transversal 3D-derived 2D planes in ED and ES. 3D contours were constructed from these tracings. If the contours or their clinical parameters differed by more than a predefined level, the tracings were compared and the experts\nwould reach a consensus interpretation on the best segmentation. One or more experts would then adapt their tracings. Final distance differences in contours were 0.77\u00b10.18mm for the training set and 0.82\u00b10.27mmfor the testing set. For the training set, 69% of contours were retraced. For the testing set, 76% of contours were retraced. The used protocol resulted in well-established ground truth contours.",

   "abstract": "In this paper, we present a fast and interactive graph cut method for 3D segmentation of the endocardial wall of the left ventricle (LV) given 3D echocardiographic images. This is a challenging task due to the poor contrast and the low signal-to-noise ratio typical of echocardiographic images. The method is carried out in 3 steps. First, 3D sampling of the LV cavity is made in a spherical-cylindrical coordinate system. Then, a gradient-based energy term is assigned to each voxel, some of which being given an infinite energy to make sure the resulting volume passes through key anatomical points. Then, a graph-cut procedure provides delineation of the endocardial surface. Results obtained on 30 exams from the 2014 CETUS MICCAI challenge dataset reveal that our method takes between 5 and 10 seconds to segment a 3D volume with an overall mean surface distance lower than 2.3 mm and an ejection fraction error of less than 5% compared to a manual tracing by an expert.",

Although recent work has shown effective endocardial edge detection, these techniques still preserve spurious anatomical edge responses that undermine overall ventricle segmentation. In this paper we propose a robust semiautomatic framework based on 2D structured learning that facilitates full 3D model-based endocardial segmentation. This method is evaluated on 30 publicly available datasets from different brands of ultrasound machines.

   "abstract": "In this paper, we present the use of a generic image segmentation method, namely a succession of Random Forest classifiers in an autocontext framework, for the MICCAI 2014 Challenge on Endocardial 3D Ultrasound Segmentation (CETUS). The proposed method segments each frame independently in 90 sec, without requiring temporal information such as end-diastolic or end-systolic time points nor any registration. For better segmentation accuracy, non-local means denoising can be applied to the images at the cost of an increased run-time. The mean Dice score on the testing dataset was 84.4% without denoising and 86.4% with denoising. The originality of our approach lies in the introduction of two classes, the myocardium and the mitral valve, in addition to the left ventricle and the background classes, in order to gain contextual information for the segmentation task.",

   "abstract": "Segmentation of 3D echocardiograms (3DEs) is still a challenging task due to the low signal-to-noise ratio, the limited field of view, and typical ultrasound artifacts. We propose to segment the left ventricular endocardial surface by using Active Appearance Models (AAMs). Separate end-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) AAMs were built from presegmented 3DEs of the CETUS training data and 25 previously acquired 3DEs, imaged using various 3DE equipment. The AAMs fully automatically segmented the 15 training sets in a leave-one-out cross validation, comparing two training populations and various initialization strategies. All segmentations took about 15 seconds per patient. The comparison on the CETUS training data shows that the AAM benefits from additional training data and more accurate initialization. The results on the CETUS training and testing data confirm good ED and ES segmentation accuracy on multi-center, multi-vendor, multi-pathology data, and corresponding EF estimation. Selection from different initialization strategies, based on the minimal residual error, and propagation of detected ED contours to initialize ES detection, contributed to more accurate segmentations in this heterogeneous population.",

The proposed method utilizes a multi-scale quadrature filter method to enhance the 3D volume, followed by a model-based level set method to segment the endocardial surface of the left ventricle. The phase map from the quadrature filters is also used to weight the influence of contour points when updating the statistical model.",

   "abstract": "Malignant gliomas are highly heterogeneous brain tumors with complex an-\nisotropic growth patterns and occult invasion. Computational modeling of cell migration and proliferation has been subject of intensive research aiming at a deeper understanding of the tumor biology and the ability to predict growth and thus improve therapy. However, current modeling techniques follow a generative approach and make strong assumptions about underlying mechanisms. The tumor is so far treated as homogeneous entity with behavioral parameters extrapolated from previous longitudinal image information.\nWe present a novel way of approaching this problem by employing data driven, discrim-\ninative modeling techniques that learn relevant features from observed growth patterns and are able to make meaningful predictions solely on basis of local and regional tissue characteristics at one given point in time.\nWe demonstrate superior performance of the proposed discriminative method (DICE score\n83) compared to the state of the art generative approach (DICE score 72) on six patients and a total of nine different time intervals. Our approach can help estimating occult invasion as well as it can advance our understanding of the tumor biology and lead to valuable predictions of tumor growth patterns that could guide and improve radio therapy.",

   "abstract": "Purpose: Recent years have seen growing interest in adaptive radiation therapy (RT), but the existing software tools are not ideal for research use, as they are either expensive and closed proprietary applications or free open-source packages with limited scope, extensibility, reliability, or user support. To address these limitations, we have developed SlicerRT, an open-source toolkit for RT research, providing fast computations and user-friendly interface for researchers. It is a medium for RT researchers to integrate their workflows in, assists clinical translation of experimental approaches, and enables comparative testing.\n\nMethods: SlicerRT builds on the widely used medical image visualization and analysis platform, 3D Slicer (www.slicer.org). In addition to the tools that 3D Slicer offers for visualization, registration and segmentation, the toolkit provides functions specifically designed for RT research. Established development processes as well as testing and validation environment ensure software quality. Standardized software development mechanisms of 3D Slicer were applied for documentation, distribution, and user support. The design and architecture of the toolkit was outlined in [1]. SlicerRT has evolved to contain the most widely used features in the field (see www.slicerrt.org), which have been defined through consensus discussions with a large pool of RT researchers.\n\nResults: Numerous modules have been developed for RT-specific features such as DICOM-RT data import and export, as well as dose analysis tools including dose volume histogram, dose accumulation, dose comparison, and isodose line and surface generation. The toolkit also includes contour analysis modules for handling various contour representations, contour morphology, and contour comparison. Advanced registration tools are provided by the included Plastimatch library [2]. The main new features developed in the last year are RT plan and RT image import and the subject hierarchy module, which arranges the loaded data to a structure familiar to clinicians, while providing advanced automation features through the underlying extendible mechanism. The toolkit is being used by several research groups to support and evaluate adaptive radiation therapy workflows. SlicerRT is available for download through the Extension Manager component of 3D Slicer 4.3 or later (see instructions on our website).\n\nFuture work: As SlicerRT has matured to contain most of the planned functions, our focus has shifted from feature development to usability and stability. The subject hierarchy module, and its features such as bulk deformation of studies embodies our efforts toward usability, while the integration of the subject hierarchy and the advanced contour handling mechanism into the 3D Slicer core points towards stability, also benefiting the whole 3D Slicer community. There is ongoing work to evaluate and potentially standardize the way the 2D contours are rasterized into 3D volumes, thus mitigating the great variability between the different solutions for this problem. Current funding ensures continuous development for several years, so SlicerRT is expected to develop further.\n\nAcknowledgement: This work was in part funded by Cancer Care Ontario through Applied Cancer Research Unit and Research Chair in Cancer Imaging grants, and the Ontario Consortium for Adaptive Invention in Radiation Oncology (OCAIRO).\n",

   "abstract": "In radiotherapy (RT) for tumor delineation and diagnostics, complementary information of multi-modal images is used. Using high ionizing radiation, the accuracy of registered volume data is crucial; therefore a reliable and robust evaluation method for registered images is needed in clinical practice. Multi-modal image registration aligns images from different modalities like computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) into one common frame of reference. The gold standard validation methods are visual inspection by radiation oncology experts and fiducial-based evaluation. However, visual inspection is a qualitative measure with a range of 2-6 mm inaccuracy, it is time consuming and prone to errors. The fiducial-based evaluation is an invasive method when fiducial markers are fixated to bone or implanted in organs. Therefore, in clinical practice a robust non-invasive automated method is needed to validate registration of multi-modal images. \nThe aim of this study is to introduce and validate an automatic landmark-based accuracy measure for multi-modal image rigid registration using feature descriptors. A porcine dataset with fixed fiducial markers was used to compare our accuracy measure with the target registration error of fiducial markers.In addition, the robustness of our evaluation method was tested on multi-vendor database consisted of 10 brain and 20 lung cases comparing the automatic landmark accuracy measure based on feature descriptors with manual landmark based evaluation. \nAn automatic, non-invasive method based on feature descriptors for accuracy evaluation of multi-modal rigid registration was introduced. The method can be used to provide accuracy information slice-by slice on CT, CBCT and CT, MR-T1, -T2 weighted, MR-T1 contrast enhanced (ce) multi-modal images.",

   "abstract": "The goal of radiation treatment is to irradiate cancer cells (i.e., a target region) without destroying adjacent healthy tissue. Thus, it is advantageous to form the beam so that it best approximates the target, thereby reducing the amount of dose absorbed in critical regions outside the target area. While multi-leaf collimators are common in human clinical systems, small animal radiotherapy systems are typically limited to a set of fixed-size collimators. For these systems, dose painting can be used for conformal dose delivery, but is significantly slower than a multi-leaf collimator. As a compromise solution, a variable rectangular collimator has been developed for the Small Animal Radiation Research Platform (SARRP). This enables more efficient dose painting via the decomposition of a 2D target region into a minimum number of rectangles of variable size, which is the topic of this paper. The proposed method consists of several distinct steps and was implemented on the SARRP Treatment Planning System (TPS).",

   "abstract": "Patient motion during radiotherapy or intra-fractional motion, is one of the major sources of uncertainty in dose application. 2D/3D registration is an intensity based method used successfully to track tumor motion with the potential to reduce uncertainty. Despite promising results, validation remains a problem due to the lack of a gold standard. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of clinical datasets acquired with the VERO LINAC to validate intensity based 2D/3D registration. The patient considered in this study had a gold marker implanted to enable live tumor tracking. We verify our results against the tracked gold marker position. Our results show that it is possible to accurately track the tumor using only intensity based 2D/3D registration. The mean error of our registration is of 1.6 \u00b1 0.3mm and as low as 1.1 \u00b1 0.5mm when looking only at the cranial-caudal direction. The results pave the way for a possible clinical application of the method.",

Atlas based segmentation is one of the most frequently used approach for automated segmentation. Especially for multi-atlas based segmentation, segmentation quality and speed largely depends on the underlying registration and atlas selection strategy. In this work an atlas selection strategy that is based on the correlation of inter-atlas similarities within a set of atlas images is presented. Segmentation quality is analyzed by calculating dice coefficients and 95% Hausdorff distances for the left and right parotid with respect to different numbers of atlases. Results are compared to other state of the art atlas selection strategies. It can be shown that the developed atlas selection technique performs slightly better than NMI-based selection if a low number of atlases is used.",

   "abstract": "Introduction. Computed tomography (CT) is the standard imaging modality for radiation therapy treatment planning (RTTP) because of its ability to provide information on electron density. However, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging provides superior soft tissue contrast, especially in small animal imaging, facilitating the precise selection of the target volume. This makes the technique interesting for irradiation of brain tumors. The aim of this study was to present an MR-only based workflow for RTTP on a small animal radiation research platform (SARRP) by investigating the potential of probabilistic classification of voxels using multiple MR sequences.\nMethods. Six female Fisher rats were anesthetized using isoflurane and individually fixed on an in-house made multimodality bed before starting MR and CT acquisitions. MR measurements were performed on a 7-Tesla system using a rat brain volume coil. Four different MR sequences were acquired for each animal, including a T1-weighted (MDEFT) sequence, a T2-weighted (RARE) sequence, an ultra-short echo time sequence with 20 \u03bcs echo time (UTE1) and an ultra- short echo time sequence with 2 ms echo time (UTE2). UTE offers the opportunity to acquire images from proton-poor structures with very short transverse relaxation times, such as bone, by using a rapid readout of the fast decaying signal. Following MR, the animals were moved to the SARRP to start a cone-beam CT (CB-CT) by acquiring 720 projections over 360\u00b0. Cone-beam CT projection data were reconstructed by filtered back-projection to obtain the standard-CT for RTTP. Then the images were bias field corrected and manually co-registered to the CB-CT. After that, images were segmented in three tissue classes (air, soft tissue and bone) with k-means for the CB-CT and fuzzy c-means segmentation algorithm (FCM) for the MR images with multiple MR images as input. The membership probability can be between 0 and 1, with one indicating 100% probability and zero indicating 0% probability to belong to a specific tissue class. To obtain a pseudo-CT image, voxels were assigned to the tissue class having the highest membership probability. The dice coefficient was used to evaluate the correctness of the segmentation for soft-tissue and bone. The pseudo-CT images with the highest similarity index were used for further radiotherapy treatment planning (RTTP), in addition, to the standard UTE1-UTE2. The target of the RTTP that was selected in the primary cortex (M1) and three different beam arrangements were investigated to compare CB-CT and MR-based dose calculations. The dose plans were a single static beam of 3x3 mm, using a single arc (3x3 mm beam size, 120\u00b0 arc, couch at 0\u00b0), and three non-coplanar arcs (3x3 mm beam size, 120\u00b0 arc, couch at 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0 and 90\u00b0). Dose distributions were calculated using the TPS of the SARRP and cumulative dose volume histograms (DVHs) of the target and normal brain tissue were obtained for the three dose plans.\nResults The highest dice coefficient was obtained for the T1-UTE1-T2 combination, which was used for further RTTP. The contribution of bone to the total dice coefficient did not exceed 27%. However, bone accounts for only 2% of the image, therefore a misclassified bone pixel has a bigger effect in the dice coefficient than a misclassified soft tissue pixel. Using only 1 beam, both MR combinations underestimate the dose to be delivered to the target. When more complex beam configurations were used to irradiate the target, very small differences were observed between CB-CT and MR based dose calculations.",

   "abstract": "Anisotropic Non-Linear Diffusion is a powerful image processing technique, which allows to simultaneously remove the noise and enhance sharp features in two or three dimensional images. Anisotropic Diffusion is understood here in the sense of Weickert, meaning that diffusion tensors are anisotropic and reflect the local orientation of image features. This is in contrast with the non-linear diffusion filter of Perona and Malik, which only involves scalar diffusion coefficients, in other words isotropic diffusion tensors. \nIn this paper, we present an anisotropic non-linear diffusion technique we implemented in ITK. This technique is based on a recent adaptive scheme making the diffusion stable and requiring limited numerical resources. ",

   "abstract": "Although phase data can take on any value, it is generally only possible to measure phase as a principle value, i.e., wrapped within the range (-pi,pi]. Determining the unwrapped phase from its principle value is a topic of considerable interest in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well as many non-medical disciplines. Despite their importance in image analysis, filters for manipulating phase information have not been incorporated into ITK. This article introduces the ITKPhase module, containing filters useful for understanding, analyzing, and unwrapping n-dimensional phase data, and also serves as a practical introduction to phase unwrapping.",

   "abstract": "This document describes the derivation of the mixture models commonly used in the literature to describe the probabilistic nature of speckle: The Gaussian Mixture Model, the Rayleigh Mixture Model, the Gamma Mixture Model and the Generalized Gamma Mixture Model. New algorithms were implemented using the Insight Toolkit\nITK for tissue characterization by means of a mixture model. \nThe source code is composed of a set of reusable ITK filters and classes. In addition to an overview of our implementation, we provide the source code, input data, parameters and output data that the authors used for validating the different probabilistic tissue characterization variants described in this paper. This adheres to the fundamental principle that scientific publications must facilitate reproducibility of the reported results.",

   "abstract": "The Fast Marching algorithm is an efficient numerical method for computing the distance and shortest path between points of a domain. For that purpose, it solves a front propagation problem, which can be of interest in itself. The method has numerous applications, ranging from motion planning to image segmentation. The unit of length, for computing the path length, may vary on the domain.\nMotivated by applications, we generalize the algorithm to the case where the unit of length also depends on the path direction. Segmentation methods can take advantage of this flexibility to achieve greater sensitivity and specificity, for a comparable computation time.\n",

   "abstract": "Isotropic volumetric acquisition in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is often challenging. A large number of factors such as patient or physiological motion, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), available static magnetic field B0 and total scanning\ntime limit the acquired resolution. Super-resolution (SR) is a post-processing tech-\nnique that optimally combines several anisotropic scans into a single isotropic volume that was not - or could not be - acquired in practice. If necessary conditions are met, the resulting isotropic volume offers clear improvements over the initial acquisitions such as reduced partial volume effect, oblique visualization and improved sharpness and SNR. This paper details the misoSR implementation of a SR isotropicreconstruction algorithm using the Insight Toolkit Library (ITK) library. It is a generic implementation that reconstructs an isotropic volume from any number of anisotropic volumes acquired from any orientation. The algorithm takes advantage of the inputs header information to handle the different scans properties such as field of view (FOV), resolution parameters and orientation. Step by step details on the implementation are given, parameters are individually detailed, and results are shown on different applications as an example of SR reconstruction. The algorithm is hosted on the Creatis Virtual Imaging Platform (VIP), which allows users to run misoSR without having to install the software on their system.",

   "abstract": "Deformable (2D or 3D) medical image registration is a challenging problem. Existing approaches assume that the underlying deformation is smooth. This smoothness assumption allows for solving the deformable registration at a coarse resolution and interpolate for finer resolutions. However, sliding of organs and breathing motion, exhibit discontinuities. We propose a discrete optimization approach to preserve these discontinuities. Solving continuous deformations using discrete optimization requires a fine distribution of the discrete labels. Coupled with the typical size of medical image datasets, this poses challenges to compute solutions efficiently. In this paper we present a practical, multi-scale formulation. We describe how discontinuities can be preserved, and how the optimization problem is solved. Results on synthetic 2D, and real 3D data show that we can well approximate the smoothness of continuous optimization, while accurately maintaining discontinuities.",

   "abstract": "Diff\u000buse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) is a leading technique for the detection of head and neck cancers. It can capture information regarding tissue absorption and scattering. In this research work, we propose a novel method for the identification of normal and Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) mucosa tissues using the Bag Of Words (BOW) approach. The study included 70 spectra from normal mucosa tissue sites and 70 spectra from SCC mucosa tissue sites. First, the spectra are preprocessed by extracting the useful wavelength range, denoising and reducing the inter and intra patient variability. Subsequently, features are extracted from each spectrum by continuously sliding a window with a predefined length along each spectrum to extract a group of local segments. Discrete Wavelet transform (DWT) is then employed for each segment. Next, we construct the codebook to represent each spectrum by a histogram of codewords at which each bin in the histogram is a count of a codeword appeared in the spectrum. Finally, the histogram representation is used as input for classification. The maximum accuracy reported is 94.28% with sensitivity and specificity of 91.42% and 97.14% respectively.",

   "abstract": "Transitive consistency of pairwise transformations is a desirable property of groupwise image registration procedures. The transformation synchronisation method (Bernard et al., 2015) is able to retrieve transitively consistent pairwise transformations from pairwise transformations that are initially not transitively consistent. In the present paper, we present a numerically stable implementation of the transformation synchronisation method for affine transformations, which can deal with very large translations, such as those occurring in medical images where the coordinate origins may be far away from each other. By using this method in conjunction with any pairwise (affine) image registration algorithm, a transitively consistent and unbiased groupwise image registration can be achieved.\nExperiments involving the average template generation from 3D brain images demonstrate that the method is more robust with respect to outliers and achieves higher registration accuracy compared to reference-based registration.",

   "abstract": "Very preterm birth coincides with a period of major development in the brain, with striking changes in volume, cortex folding and significant change at the microstructural level. Diffusion MRI is sensitive to motion of water on the scale of microns, allowing us to investigate some of these changes. Mapping of diffusion tensors is a challenging process, and existing methods fail to account for the major changes that take place between 30 and 40 weeks equivalent gestational age. In this paper we introduce the spectral matching in the context of non-linear registration of diffusion images. Spatial correspondences are defined with respect to the main spectral modes of the images, which are global descriptors of the tensor information. We apply tensor spectral matching (TSM) in two different ways: by estimation of spatial correspondences uniquely based on the spectral decomposition of diffusion tensor images, and by combination of TSM with a standard diffusion tensor registration algorithm (TSM-DTI-TK). We validate the proposed approaches on 20 adult controls, and we compare it to the state-of-art registration method. We then apply these methods to longitudinal diffusion data acquired from 6 extremely preterm-born infants scanned shortly after birth and at term equivalent age. The experimental results combining TSM with standard tensor registration outperform the state-of-art when applied to both adult and preterm data. Having a reliable anatomical correspondence in preterm infants allows us to quantify microstructural changes and to work towards developing biomarkers of neurological impairment.",

   "abstract": "Medical image analyses rely on diverse software packages assembled into a \u201cpipeline\u201d. The Java Image Science Toolkit (JIST) has served as a standalone plugin into the Medical Image Processing Analysis and Visualization (MIPAV). We addressed shortcomings that previously prevented deeper integration of JIST with other E-science platforms. First, we developed an interface for integrating externally compiled packages (similar to the interfaces in NiPy) such that the application can become a \u201cdraggable module\u201d in the module tree. This allows for connection of inputs and outputs to other JIST modules while maintaining external processing and monitoring. Second, we develop an integration interface with the Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resources Clearinghouse Cloud Environment (NITRC-CE). User can launch and terminate pre-configured nodes to utilize computational resources of the Amazon cloud. Finally, we define a new external data source, which can connect to the eXtensible Neuroimaging Archive Toolkit (XNAT) to query and retrieve remote data using XNAT's REST API. Specifically, we define dataflow for files that can readily be converted into volumes and collections of volumes to interface with any JIST module that expects volumetric image data as an input. Users now have the ability to run their pipelines from a well-defined external data source and no longer are required to already have data on the disk. With these upgrades we have extended JIST\u2019s capabilities outside of complied java source code and enhanced capabilities to seamlessly interface with E-science platforms. ",

   "abstract": "A multi-atlas approach is proposed for the automatic segmentation of nine different structures in a set of head and neck CT images for radiotherapy. The approach takes advantage of a training dataset of 25 images to build average head and neck atlases of high-quality. By registering patient images with the atlases at the global level, structures of interest are aligned approximately in space, which allowed multi-atlas-based segmentations and correlation-based label fusion to be performed at the local level in the following steps. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations are performed on a set of 15 testing images. As shown by the results, mandible, brainstem and parotid glands are segmented accurately (mean volume DSC>0.8). The segmentation accuracy for the optic nerves is also improved over previously reported results (mean DSC above 0.61 compared with 0.52 for previous results). ",

High quality anatomical correspondences for the models are generated using a Minimum Description Length (MDL) Groupwise Image Registration method. A multi start optimisation scheme is used to robustly match the model to new images. The model has been cross validated on the training data to a good degree of accuracy, and successfully segmented all the test data. \n",

   "abstract": "We describe a segmentation method that was used in the Head and Neck Auto Segmentation Challenge held at the MICCAI 2015 conference. The algorithm consists of two building blocks. First, we employ a multi-atlas segmentation to obtain an initial segmentation for the considered organs at risk. Secondly, we use an Active Shape Model (ASM) segmentation to refine the initial segmentation of some of the organs. Leave-one-out experiments with the training data were used to determine suitable parameters for the individual steps of the segmentation. The ASM refinement resulted in improved segmentation for the optic nerves and submandibular glands, while for the brain stem, parotid glands, chiasm, and mandibular bone, the multi-atlas segmentation was preferable. Our submission achieved the second rank in the challenge.",

In recent years, the ITK developers' community has focused on providing programming interfaces to ITK from Python, Java, and Javascript and making ITK available via leading applications such as Slicer and ImageJ. In this course we present best practices for taking advantage of ITK in your imaging research and commercial products. We demonstrate how script writing and interactive GUIs can be used to access the algorithms in ITK and the multitude of ITK extensions that are freely available on the web. We also cover the opportunities and challenges with using open-source software in research and in commercial applications: from prototypes that can lead to venture capital funding to applications for first-in-human trials and ultimately for regulatory approval.",

   "abstract": "The common approach to do a fully automatic segmentation of multiple structures is an atlas or multi-atlas based solution.\nThese already have proven to be suitable for the segmentation of structures in the head and neck area and provide very accurate segmentation results, but can struggle with challenging cases with unnatural postures, where the registration of the reference patient(s) is extremely difficult.\nTherefore, we propose an coupled shape model (CoSMo) algorithm for the segmentation relevant structures in parallel. The model adaptation to a test image is done with respect to the appearance of its items and the trained articulation space. Even on very challenging data sets with unnatural postures, which occur far more often than expected, the model adaptation algorithm succeeds.\nThe approach is based on an articulated atlas \\cite{Steger2012a}, that is trained from a set of manually labeled training samples. Furthermore, we have combined the initial solution with statistical shape models \\cite{Kirschner2011} to represent structures with high shape variation. CoSMo is not tailored to specific structures or regions. It can be trained from any set of given gold standard segmentations and makes it thereby very generic.",

The aim is to utilize spatial relationship of anatomic landmarks with image processing techniques to detect mandible robustly and efficiently. Applying prior knowledge and reliable anatomical landmarks to define an optimal Region of Interest (ROI) which contains the mandible is an effective way for fast localization and successful segmentation. This approach can be used to segment other structures such as optic nerves by defining a new set of relevant landmarks. This approach is robust to CT data with different scanner setting and does not require large training data sets.",

These resources provide metrics to quantify\nsoftware computational performance. This is a pre-requisite to improve performance either through\nalgorithmic advancements or better utilization of hardware resources.\nComputational performance is quantified by reducing factors that confound timing measurements and\nby estimating measurement variance. New classes are presented that increase operating system process\npriority to minimize the impact of other processes running on the system. System hardware characteristics\nare extracted and displayed. The influence of hard disk input/output on runtime measurements is\nremoved in the suite of benchmarks. Additionally, the number of threads used by each benchmark can be\nspecified. These benchmarks consist of common analysis pipelines and run on 3D magnetic resonance\nbrain image data so realistic performance is quantified. Benchmarks can be executed with multiple iterations,\nand timing statistics are recorded in tab separated value (.tsv) files, which are easily stored or\nprocessed for further analysis and visualization.\nThis paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and output data that the authors\nused for validating the algorithm described in this paper.

   "abstract": "Binary morphological operations are fundamental tools in image processing but the processing time scales with the number of pixels thus making them expensive operations on the CPU for larger 3D datasets that typically appear in medical imaging. Since erosion and dilatation are special neighborhood operators, each pixel in the output depends only on the neighborhood region which makes them fit for massive GPU parallelization. This document introduces a new ITK module that implements generic (OpenCL based) GPU accelerated binary morphology image filters for erosion and dilatation. The filter can be executed within the standard ITKGPU pipeline.",

   "abstract": "Modern medical imaging makes use of high performance computing to accelerate image acquisition, image reconstruction, image visualization and image analysis. Software libraries that provide implementations of key medical imaging algorithms need to efficiently exploit modern CPU architectures. In particular, workstations with small numbers of cores are being replaced by very high core count architectures, and by many integrated core architectures, which offer acceleration by vectorization and multi-threading.\n\nThe Insight Toolkit (ITK) is the premier open source implementation of medical imaging algorithms, with a generic design for image processing filters that allows for many developers to rapidly incorporate these algorithms in to new applications. While ITK filters benefit from a generic, platform independent multithreading capability, the current implementation is difficult to exploit to achieve very high performance. Specifically, ITK relies on a static decomposition of the image into subsets of equal size which can be highly inefficient. Threads that terminate early due to uneven work throughout the image finish early and do not contribute further to the processing of more complex regions, leading to idle computational resources and longer execution times. Performance is also difficult to coordinate across multiple algorithms, as the ITK filter assumes each filter operates independently but the global implementation has an impact across filters. \n\nIn this work, we propose a novel, simple to use, high performance multithreading capability for ITK that accelerates the itk::ImageToImageFilter. We utilise a workpile data decomposition strategy, and leave the task of optimal job scheduling on CPU cores to the library called Threading Building Blocks (TBB). We demonstrate the efficacy of multi-threading with TBB in comparison to the itk::Multithreader class, through three simple example image analysis algorithms. \n\nOur implementation provides a new multi-threaded itk::ImageToImageFilter that can be conveniently reused to provide simple and efficient multi-threaded code across applications and algorithm libraries. Our new implementation is distributed as open-source software to the community and is straightforward to adopt.",

     "content": "In this article, the authors summarize challenges related to parallelism\r\nin modern high performance computing and present improvements to the Insight\r\nToolkit (ITK) with Threading Building Blocks (TBB).\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis is that threads in many-core CPUs are starved for work given\r\nthe way that data is divided and distributed among threads. A more\r\nfine-grained and dynamic data decomposition and improved job scheduling will\r\nimprove performance.\r\n\r\nThe authors provide source code, data, and bash scripts for a quality,\r\nreproducible open science publication. Proposed improvements to ITK image\r\nprocessing filters with TBB are described, and evidence for the improvements\r\nare provided with example, realistic DWI processing.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is an excellent publication that describes the high performance\r\ncomputing challenges in ITK well and touches on an appropriate solution with\r\nTBB. While the hypothesis that performance gains are likely partially related\r\nto idle threads as proposed, much of the performance gains are also likely due\r\nto reduce overhead from spawning and destroying threads. This work has the\r\npotential to be very high impact. The improvements to a very large number of\r\nalgorithms available in ITK are significant. While the benchmarking performed\r\nwas on a 12-core Xeon system, which is a common system today, systems are coming\r\navailable, like the Knight's Landing Phi processor, which will experience\r\neven greater performance improvements.\r\n\r\nThe following improvements and next steps will ensure this work is high\r\nimpact:\r\n\r\nThe main code should be submitted to the Gerrit code review system, and\r\nimprovements should be made to ensure it works on all supported platforms,\r\nfollows ITK style guidelines, etc. This process is described here:\r\n\r\n  https://itk.org/ITKSoftwareGuide/html/Book1/ITKSoftwareGuide-Book1ch10.html\r\n\r\n\r\nIn practice, it is not possible to have a hard dependency on TBB for ITK. TBB\r\ncannot be bundled with ITK because of its size, its license, and its build\r\nsystem. It can be difficult to obtain and configure against. It does not\r\nsupport all platforms that people use with ITK. So, the addition should be an\r\noptional ITK configuration setting enabled with CMake.\r\n\r\nSince it is not practical to maintain two duplicate version of all filters,\r\nthe proposed code should be added to itk::ImageSource when TBB is available\r\nwhich will not require duplication or modification of existing filters.\r\n\r\nIt may be possible for existing filters to re-use their\r\nThreadedGenerateData method by passing the tbb::block_range::begin() value as a\r\nsubstitute for the ThreadIdType argument. While this is not the thread id, it\r\nmay fulfill the needs of how many filters, which currently use the\r\nargument to conditionally performing operations when its value is 0, perform\r\nprogress reporting, etc. An optional specialized TBB method could be\r\nimplemented by filters and used when available.\r\n\r\nIn terms of data division, another improvement would implement the proposed\r\nstrategy as an implementation of the itk::ImageRegionSplitterBase or\r\nitk::ThreadedDomainPartitioner class, and set this new class as the default when TBB\r\nis enabled. This will make it possible to override the strategy with other\r\nimplementations in the future.\r\n",

   "abstract": "Anisotropic and isotropic diffusion equations have been extensively applied on biomedical image processing for many years and a great diversity of algorithm have been proposed by the scientific community. Here, it is available a recent new implementation of the anomalous diffusion equation, based on the Fokker-Planck PDE diffusion equation (also known as the Porous Media equation). The major contribution of the anomalous process in the image processing area is the possibility to regulates a sub or super-diffusion characteristic in the noise attenuation problem, which have been showed as a suitable solution for the preservation of fine details in complex objects such as the human brain. An ITK Module is offered here in order to easily add the Anisotropic Anomalous Diffusion (AAD) and Isotropic Anomalous Diffusion (IAD) filters in the ITK hierarchy.",

This module provides classes for perturbing the positions of the vertices of either an itk::Mesh or itk::QuadEdgeMesh with Gaussian noise. This may be useful in testing the robustness of an algorithm to small changes in the input mesh, augmenting datasets for machine learning, and counteracting deleterious effects which highly regular regions of a mesh may occasionally have on mesh processing. After demonstrating basic usage, we present a practical example to show how these classes can be incorporated into a pipeline to improve mesh quality.",

We follow-up up that offering with a generalized non-local, patch-based ITK class framework and a refactored denoising class. In addition, we provide two ITK implementations of related, well-known algorithms. The first is a non-local super resolution method described in [1, 2]. The second is the multivariate joint label fusion algorithm of [4, 5] with additional extensions, denoted as \u201cjoint intensity fusion\u201d, which will be described in a forthcoming manuscript.

   "abstract": "The anisotropic diffusion algorithm has been intensively studied in the past decades, which could be considered as a very efficient image denoising procedure in many biomedical applications. Several authors contributed many clever solutions for diffusion parameters fitting in specific imaging modalities. Furthermore, besides improvements regarding the image denoising quality, one important variable that must be carefully set is the conductance, which regulates the structural edges preservation among the objects presented in the image. The conductance value is strongly dependent on image noise level and an appropriate parameter setting is, usually, difficult to find for different images databases and modalities. Fortunately, thanks to many efforts from the scientific community, a few automatic methods have been proposed in order to set the conductance value automatically. Here, it is presented an ITK class which offers a simple collection of the most common automatic conductance setting approaches in order to assist researchers in image denoising procedures using anisotropic-based filtering methods (such as well described in the AnisotropicDiffusionFunction class).",

This module contains two texture analysis filters that are used to compute feature maps of N-Dimensional images using two well-known texture analysis methods. The two filters contained in this module are itkScalarImageToTextureFeaturesImageFilter (which computes textural features based on intensity-based co-occurrence matrices in the image) and itkScalarImageToRunLengthFeaturesImageFilter (which computes textural features based on equally valued intensity clusters of different sizes or run lengths in the image). The output of this module is a vector image of the same size than the input that contains a multidimensional vector in each pixel/voxel. Filters can be configured based in the locality of the textural features (neighborhood size), offset directions for co-ocurrence and run length computation, the number of bins for the intensity histograms, the intensity range or the range of run lengths.

   "abstract": "The Insight Toolkit (ITK) utilizes a generic design for image processing filters that allows many developers to rapidly implement new algorithms. While ITK filters benefit from a platform-independent and versatile multithreading capability, the current implementation does not easily achieve high performance. First, ITK relies on a static decomposition of the image into subsets of equal size which is highly inefficient when the computational complexity varies between subsets (unbalanced workloads). Second, the current domain decomposition is limited to subdivide the input domain along a single dimension (typically the slice dimension in a 3-D volume), which causes a multithreading under-utilization when the number of threads is larger than the size of this dimension when using massively parallel compute systems. We previously presented a new itk::TBBImageToImageFilter class that replaced the static task decomposition by a dynamic task decomposition for improved workload balancing, in which the job scheduling task was optimized using the Intel\u00ae Threading Building Blocks (TBB) library. In this work, we propose a new multidimensional dynamic image decomposition approach that allows decomposition over an arbitrary number of dimensions. This new generic multithreading capability, combined with the TBB dynamic task scheduler, substantially improves multithreading performance when using massively parallel processors.",
