{"title": "3D Voxel-Based Volumetric Image Registration with Volume-View Guidance", "abstract": "In this article, we will present a novel interactive image registration technique using the 3D volumetric view as guidance throughout the registration process. The registration criterion used in this technique is the homogeneity of the color distribution on any given anatomic landmark, usually the skin/muscle voxels. This registration criterion has been validated using two different approaches, including comparison with automatic registration using mutual information based on the Insight Toolkits (ITK) and comparison with registered MR images with different pulse sequences acquired directly from the same MR scanner less than 5 minutes. An investigation is also made to compare this technique with the conventional interactive image registration using three orthogonal planar (3P) views, which is predominantly used in the current treatment planning in clinic. This 3D technique has shown several advantages, including improved registration accuracy and accelerated registration speed. It has also found that the 3P pixel registration technique often \"inherits\" a global positioning error, due to its partial 3D visual presentation. In addition, unlike the 3P technique, which generally cannot be used to register more than 2 images simultaneously and low resolution PET images, this 3D technique can register up to 4 imaging modalities simultaneously, including PET images, with both global view guidance and detail checking capability.", "date_submitted": "2005-07-22T14:08:07Z", "publication_id": 9},

{"title": "A Framework for Algorithm Evaluation and Clinical Application Prototyping using ITK", "abstract": "The usage of image processing has become an important and continuous growing field in medical imaging. Although a large amount of algorithms is available, only few are routinely applied within applications for clinical diagnosis support and treatment planning. New tools are required that allow for efficient evaluation and comparison of algorithms as well as the \r\ngeneration of dedicated user interfaces with sophisticated visualization for clinical applications. We propose a generic integration of ITK algorithms into the visual programming and rapid prototyping platform MeVisLab. One of the main limitation of ITK is its lack of visualization and interaction functionality through a dedicated development platform. MeVisLab provides a modular visual programming interface with a comprehensive suite of image processing and visualization tools. The linkage of ITK algorithms to MeVisLab is based on a two step process that consists of a generic XML description for each ITK algorithm and an automatic code generator to create new MeVisLab modules, which will be made publicly available within the free version of MeVisLab. Each module can handle different image types and data dimensions dynamically at runtime. Example applications using registration, segmentation, and visualization modules are presented in order to show the capabilities of the described integration concept.", "date_submitted": "2005-07-29T13:15:43Z", "publication_id": 12},

{"title": "Cumulative Gaussian Curve Fitter for Boundary Parameterization", "abstract": "We have previously developed an algorithm for locating boundaries in an image with sub-pixel resolution, as well as estimating boundary width and image intensity within the adjoining objects. The algorithm operates by finding the parameters of a cumulative Gaussian curve that best approximates an intensity profile taken across a boundary. If intensity is sampled along the image gradient across a boundary, it is reasonable to assume the profile approximates a finite portion of a cumulative Gaussian. Given that assumption, the first derivative of the profile should be the corresponding portion of a Gaussian, completely described by its mean, standard deviation, and amplitude. We present here a simple and rapid method to find those parameters, given that we only have a potentially skewed sample of the Gaussian. The parameters are approximated first for the finite sample, and then both ends of the Gaussian are extrapolated using the resulting parameters. New parameters are then calculated and the procedure is repeated. The optimization rapidly converges, yielding boundary location (mean) with sub-pixel accuracy as well boundary width (standard deviation). Integration then reproduces the cumulative Gaussian, and a least-squares fit is applied to estimate the constant of integration, from which intensity of the adjoining regions can be estimated.", "date_submitted": "2005-08-05T21:30:12Z", "publication_id": 37},

{"title": "Unsupervised Segmentation for Myofiber Counting in Immunofluorescent Microscopy Images", "abstract": "The gold standard for measuring muscle regeneration in muscular dystrophy therapies is counting the number of dystrophin-positive muscle fibers on a cryostat muscle section immunostained for dystrophin. The standard process of manually counting a few thousand myofibers is tedious, time consuming, and limits quantitative analysis of a therapy success. We present an unsupervised method for segmenting and counting the number of myofibers on an immunofluorescent microscopy image. The key threshold selection problem is resolved by maximizing the number of sub-threshold connected components. Components significantly smaller than the known lower bound myofiber area, the only input parameter, are ignored to reduce noise. Validation on a series of images (n=63) revealed that our algorithm varied by less than 10% from manual counts in the relevant range of operation. The algorithm allows us to quantify three-dimensional dystrophin expression and design experiments that address a major limitation in muscular dystrophy therapies, the limited distribution of dystrophin after treatment.

Its main limitations is the necessity of spherical topology. \n\nThe input of the proposed shape analysis is a set of binary segmentation of a single brain structure, such as the hippocampus or caudate.

After alignment, differences between groups of surfaces are computed using the Hotelling $T^2$ two sample metric. Statistical p-values, both raw and corrected for multiple comparisons, result in significance maps. Additional visualization of the group tests are provided via mean difference magnitude and vector maps, as well as maps of the group covariance information.\n\nThe correction for multiple comparisons is performed via two separate methods that each have a distinct view of the problem.

The thickness of a volumetric layer at a point on the bounding surface is the distance from that point to the opposite surface. There exist several definitions for the layer thickness.

The thickness values calculated by the radial thickness definition are unique and does not depend on the starting surface. In this paper, we describe a class for calculating the radial thickness of one volumetric layer represented as coupled and nested triangle meshes. \r\n\r\nThe class, vtkRadialThicknessCalculate, is implemented using the Visualization Toolkit (VTK).

{"title": "Parameterization of discrete surfaces", "abstract": "Parameterization of surfaces, sometimes alled ”‘flattening”’ as it maps a surface embedded in 3D into its intrinsic 2D domain, is a powerfull tool for the analysis of surfaces. For the past years, there has been a growing interest in the Community that even lead to one implementation of one special type of parameterization in ITK [1,5,8,9]. We are providing here a more general framework for parameterization of single connected surfaces of any genus. It is based on a recent addition to ITK: itkQuadEdgeMesh [6] which allows an elegant an optimal implementation of algorithm for geometry and topology processing of discrete 2-manifolds. The 5 algorithms that we implemented map the meshes into a planar domain with fixed boundary leading to more stability and speed than mapping into the spherical domain. Each of them use different kind of parameterization with different properties. The conformal parameterization is usually used as it is intrinsic to the geometry of the mesh and thus allow shape analysis independently of the connectivity. However if flattening the mesh is your only goal, then the simplest parameterization algorithm (graph theory) will give you the best speed. This is the case when you want to further process the mesh in a lower dimension. Using specific solvers, the parameterization of meshes can be done sufficiently fast (couple of seconds) to consider this approach in interactive applications.", "date_submitted": "2007-11-22", "publication_id": 202},

Using a gradient-based cost function, a {em live-wire} image path from the seed point to a subsequently placed boundary point is determined.

Image-Guided Surgical Toolkit is a software toolkit designed to enable biomedical researchers to rapidly prototype and create new applications for image-guided surgery. In IGSTK, in which the coordinate systems and the transforms are being successfully used, there is no central data structure or repository, which will hold all the coordinate systems and the transforms between them. Such a data structure could help the IGSTK software developers to have more confidence in the code they have written. This project develops a tool, which will create such a data structure and dynamically show the changes to it, to help such software developers to write better code.", "date_submitted": "2008-12-15 13:39:42", "publication_id": 309},

Pulse Wave Imaging (PWI) is an ultrasonography-based imaging method that has been developed to map and quantify the pulse wave (PW) propagation along the abdominal aortic wall and measure its local properties. We present a finite-element-based approach that aims at improving our understanding of the complex PW patterns observed by PWI and their relationship to the underlying mechanical properties. A Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) coupled model was developed based on an idealized axisymmetric aorta geometry.

{"title": "Coronary centerline tracking in CT images with use of an elastic model and image moments.", "abstract": "This coronary-artery extraction method uses one initialization point per vessel. First, a mask is computed by use of a region-growing algorithm, which starts from the initial point and stops when no more connected voxels fall within an interactively defined intensity range. The centerline tracking is then\nperformed within the mask, starting from the same initial point. This algorithm is based on a prediction/estimation scheme. It uses the first- and second-order image moments calculated within a spherical volume that slides along the vessel, and the radius of which is automatically adjusted to the local radius\nof the vessel. The evolution of the radius of the sphere is based on the analysis of the eigenvalues of the inertia matrix in a multi-scale framework. The estimation of the current point location makes use\nof an elastic model similar to ”snakes”. The point iteratively moves under the action of an image-force attracting it to the local gravity center, and under the reaction of the internal forces of the model, which\nreflect its shape constraints: continuity and smoothness. The prediction makes use of the eigenvectors of\nthe inertia matrix. The stopping criteria of the centerline tracking are based on the size of the sphere and on the percentage of the masked voxels within the sphere.\nOn 8 training CT datasets, the following mean results were obtained. Overlap with reference: considering the whole length (OV) 80.1%, until the first failure (OF) 48.9%, in clinically relevant segments (radius > 1.5 mm, OT) 81.7%. Average distance from reference: considering the whole length\n(AD) 4.32 mm, limited to segments where the semiautomatic centerline remains within the vessel (AI) 0.39 mm, in clinically relevant segments (AT) 4.13 mm. On 16 testing datasets, these results were respectively: OV =80.2%, OF =39.3%, OT =82.1%, AD =5.05 mm, AI =0.41 mm and AT =4.58 mm. \nA number of failures was due to the the fact that the model does not handle the bifurcations.", "date_submitted": "2009-07-22 04:10:56", "publication_id": 575},

The MICCAI workshop Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation Challenge 08 allows to test and compare these algorithms. This paper presents a method designed to detect hyperintense signal area on T2-FLAIR sequence and its results on the Challenge test data. The proposed algorithm uses only three conventional MRI sequences: T1, T2 and T2-FLAIR. First, images are cropped, spatially unbiased and skull-stripped. A segmentation of the brain into its different compartments is performed on the T1 and the T2 sequences. From these segmentations, a threshold for the T2-FLAIR sequence is automatically computed. Then postprocessing operations select the most plausible lesions in the obtained hyperintense signals. Global result on the test data (80/100) is close to the inter-expert variability (90/100).", "date_submitted": "2008-07-15T13:51:28Z", "publication_id": 613},

At present, however, the collection, synchronization and transfer of ultrasonic images are more cumbersome than necessary. This paper presents a reusable solution to these problems. We propose a software package called SynchroGrab, which allows the collection of interventional ultrasound images as well as their synchronization with a stream of pose measurements. The software includes support for an open-interface ultrasound system, namely the Sonix RP, from Ultrasonix (Vancouver, Canada). Using an open-interface system like the Sonix RP allows customization of the imaging process and the capture of the ultrasound images directly from memory without the need for a frame-grabbing card. Pose measurement is currently performed with an Optotrak Certus by Northern Digital (Waterloo, Canada). However, extensibility was a primary goal in the design of this software, so the support of new devices can be achieved simply by sub-classing the relevant base class. SynchroGrab also performs reconstruction of 3D ultrasound volumes from synchronized data streams. Moreover, the recorded images, volumes and tracking information are available for visualization or further processing either directly from the file system or from a network connection compliant with the OpenIGTLink protocol, which is supported by Slicer 3.", "date_submitted": "2008-07-18T15:27:39Z", "publication_id": 618},

The resulting meshes were evaluated for mesh quality and compared to the force based method. An initial evaluation was performed using a mathematical phantom. The algorithm was then applied to generate meshes for the phalanx bones of the human hand. The algorithm successfully mapped the template bone to all of the bony surfaces, with the exception of the distal phalanx bone.

CIS systems could have a similar impact on surgery to that long since realized in Computer-Integrated Manufacturing (CIM). Mathematical modeling and computer simulation have proved tremendously successful in engineering. Computational mechanics has enabled technological developments in virtually every area of our lives. One of the greatest challenges for mechanists is to extend the success of computational mechanics to fields outside traditional engineering, in particular to biology, the biomedical sciences, and medicine. \r\n\r\nComputational Biomechanics for Medicine Workshop series was established in 2006 with the first meeting held in Copenhagen.

In this paper, classical multidimensional scaling (MDS), which gives a geometric interpretation to input dissimilarity data, is used to classify 180 sulci drawn from the ten major classes of sulci. Using a leave-one-out validation strategy, we acheive a success rate of 100% in the best case and 78% in the worst case. For these more difficult cases, we propose a second stage of classification using shape based features. One of these features is the geodesic distance between sulcal curves obtained from a new open curve representation in a geometric framework.\r\nWith MDS, we oﬀer a simple and intuitive approach to a challenging problem. Not only can we easily separate left and right brain sulci, but we also narrow the classification problem from, in this case, a 10-class to a 2-class problem.

{"title": "Construction of Statistical Shape Models from Minimal Deformations", "abstract": "Abstract. Statistical shape models (SSM) capture the variation of shape across a population, in order to allow further analysis. Previous work demonstrates that deformation fields contain global transformation components, even if global pre-\r\nregistration is performed. It is crucial to construction of SSMs to remove these global transformation components from the local deformations - thus obtaining minimal deformations - prior to using these as input for SSM construction. In medical image processing, parameterized SSMs based on control points of free-form deformations (FFD) are a popular choice, since they offer several advantages compared to SSMs based on dense deformation ﬁelds. In this work, we extend the previous approach by presenting a framework for construction of both, unparameterized and FFD-based SSMs from minimal deformations. The core of the method is computation of minimal deformations by extraction of the linear part from the original dense deformations. For FFD-based SSMs, the FFD-parameterization of the minimal deformations is performed by projection onto the space of FFDs. Both steps are computed by close-form solutions optimally in the least-square sense. The proposed method is evaluated on a data set of 62 MR images of the corpus callosum. The results show a significant improvement achieved by the proposed method for SSMs built on dense ﬁelds, as well as on FFD-based SSMs.", "date_submitted": "2008-09-12 11:52:15", "publication_id": 635},

{"title": "Morphological Appearance Manifolds in Computational Anatomy: Groupwise Registration and Morphological Analysis", "abstract": "The ﬁeld of computational anatomy has developed rigorous frameworks for analyzing anatomical shape, based on diffeomorphic transformations of a template. However, differences in algorithms used for template warping, in regularization parameters, and in the template itself, lead to different representations of the same anatomy. Variations of these parameters are considered as confounding factors. Recently, extensions of the conventional computational anatomy framework to account for such confounding variations has shown that learning the equivalence class derived from the multitude of representations can lead to improved and more stable morphological descriptors. Herein, we follow that approach, estimating the morphological appearance manifold obtained by varying parameters of the template warping procedure. Our approach parallels work in the computer vision ﬁeld, in which variations lighting, pose and other parameters leads to image appearance manifolds representing the exact same ﬁgure in different ways. The proposed framework is then used for groupwise registration and statistical analysis of biomedical images, by employing a minimum variance criterion to perform manifold-constrained optimization, i.e. to traverse each individual’s morphological appearance manifold until all individuals' representations come as close to each other as possible. Eﬀectively,\r\nthis process removes the aforementioned confounding eﬀects and potentially leads to morphological representations reﬂecting purely biological variations, instead of variations introduced by modeling assumptions and parameter settings.

A particularly salient advantage of this algorithm is that it does not require a prior tissue model for its application.

Slice contiguous images are three-dimensional images, in which each slice is stored in a contiguous 1-D array, but the slices are not necessarily adjacent in memory. Slice contiguous images are well suited for interoperability with applications representing images using DICOM. Sparse images are n-dimensional images, in which each pixel is stored in a hash table data structure. This memory model is well suited for images with very large dimensions, but few pixels which are actually relevant.

We describe the implementation of a CAI software based on extending core 3D Slicer functions. Three enhancements are described in detail: the management of workflow, DICOM image transfer, and multiple views. The resulting software fulfills general CAI requirements and supports two different MRI-guided prostate biopsy systems (each with a different imaging mode, robotic manipulator and calibration method), thereby demonstrating the usability of Slicer for implementing different CAI applications.", "date_submitted": "2009-08-14 22:39:57", "publication_id": 649},

It allows for development of complex algorithms by creating a custom pipeline where the output of an algorithm can serve as an input for another algorithm. All of the functionality is encapsulation into the object \nrequiring no separate source code for user interfaces, testing or deployment.

Ultrasound (US) is often the best imaging modality for this application, as it provides good contrast and spatial resolution while remaining simple to integrate into the operating room. However, conventional 2D US imaging is often insufficient for preoperative planning and surgical guidance, real-time 3D ultrasound imaging using matrix array probes has a smaller field of view and lower spatial resolution, and 3D volumes created using 3D US reconstruction suffer from motion artifacts. As an alternative, gated 4D ultrasound reconstruction using a tracked 2D US probe is a promising technology. In this paper, we present SynchroGrab4D to the open-source community.

Calculations of these parameters depend upon accurate delineation of endocardial and epicardial contours of the left ventricle (LV). Manual delineation is time-consuming and tedious and has high inter-observer variability. Thus, fully automatic LV segmentation is desirable. \n\nThe automatic segmentation of the LV in cine MR typically faces four challenges: 1) the overlap between the intensity distributions within the cardiac regions; 2) the lack of edge information; 3) the shape variability of the endocardial and epicardial contours across slices and phases; and 4) the inter-subject variability of these factors. A number of methods have been proposed for (semi-) automatic LV segmentation, including using a probability atlas [1], dynamic programming [2-3], fuzzy clustering [4], a deformable model [5], an active appearance model [6], a variational and level set [7-10], graph cuts [11-12] and an image-driven approach [13]. For a complete review of recent literature describing cardiac segmentation techniques, see [14]. Although the segmentation results have improved, accurate LV segmentation is still acknowledged as a difficult problem.\n\nThe goals of this contest are to compare LV segmentation methods by providing an evaluation system, and a database of images and expert contours. Comparing segmentation results across research studies can be difficult due to unspecified differences in the method or implementation of evaluation metrics. This contest will provide open-source code for contour evaluation.

After localizing the left ventricle blood pool using motion, thresholding and clustering, slices are segmented sequentially. For each slice, deformable registration is used to align all the phases, candidate contours are recovered in the average image using shortest paths, and a minimal surface is built to generate the final contours. The advantage of our method is that the resulting contours follow the edges in each phase and are consistent over time. As part of the MICCAI grand challenge on left ventricle segmentation, we demonstrate using 15 training datasets and 15 validation datasets that the results are very good with average errors around 2 mm and the method is ready for clinical routine.", "date_submitted": "2009-07-29 16:19:56", "publication_id": 684},

In this paper, we present a fully automated, atlas-based segmentation method and apply it to tackle the H&N CT image segmentation problem in the MICCAI 2009 3D Segmentation\nGrand Challenge. The proposed method employs a multiple atlas fusion strategy and a hierarchical atlas registration approach. We also exploit recent advancements in GPU technology to accelerate the deformable atlas registration and to make multi-atlas segmentation computationally feasible in practice. Validation results on the eight clinical datasets distributed by the MICCAI workshop showed that the proposed method gave very accurate segmentation of the mandible and the brainstem, with a volume\noverlap close to or above 90% for most subjects.

It is obvious that those institutions, which are quality conscious and are committed to continuous quality improvement, will gain the highest consumer acceptance and will flourish at the expense of others.

Our implementation follows the same underlying mathematics of Hough transforms (as implemented by the 2D filters) but with some minor variations.

The user is not required to specify seed regions apriori which greatly eases the task of automatic segmentation. The thresholds are determined using Otsu's minimization of between-class variances in local image regions that are selected randomly throughout the domain. Using non-uniformly sampled thresholds, a continuous function is reconstructed throughout the image domain using a B-Spline approximation algorithm. Hence, the image domain is adaptively sampled by making use of the reconstructed threshold function.

{"title": "An Intelligent cluster-based segmentation using Wavelet Features:Application to Medical Images", "abstract": "Segmentation forms the onset for image analysis especially for medical images, making any abnormalities in tissues distinctly visible. Possible application includes the detection of tumor boundary in SPECT, MRI or electron MRI (EMRI). Nevertheless, tumors being heterogeneous pose a great problem when automatic segmentation is attempted to accurately detect the region of interest (ROI). Consequently, it is a challenging task to design an automatic segmentation algorithm without the incorporation of 'a priori' knowledge of an organ being imaged. To meet this challenge, here we propose an intelligence-based approach integrating evolutionary k-means algorithm within multi-resolution framework for feature segmentation with higher accuracy and lower user interaction cost. The approach provides several advantages. First, spherical coordinate transform (SCT) is applied on original RGB data for the identification of variegated coloring as well as for significant computational overhead reduction. Second the translation invariant property of the discrete wavelet frames (DWF) is exploited to define the features, color and texture using chromaticity of LL band and luminance of LH and HL band respectively. Finally, the genetic algorithm based K-means (GKA), which has the ability to learn intelligently the distribution of different tissue types without any prior knowledge, is adopted to cluster the feature space with optimized cluster centers. \nExperimental results of proposed algorithm using multi-modality images such as MRI, SPECT, and EMRI are presented and analyzed in terms of error measures to verify its effectiveness and feasibility for medical applications.", "date_submitted": "2010-04-07 00:48:34", "publication_id": 723},

The first is the ability to deploy components among different processes (as conventionally done) or within the same process (for optimal real-time performance), without requiring source-level modifications to the component. This is particularly relevant for real-time video processing, where the use of multiple processes could cause perceptible delays in the video stream. The second key feature is the ability to dynamically reconfigure the system. In a system composed of multiple processes on multiple computers, this allows one process to be restarted (e.g., after correcting a problem) and reconnected to the rest of the system, which is more convenient than restarting the entire distributed application and enables better fault recovery. The third key feature is the availability of run-time tools for data collection, interactive control, and introspection, and offline tools for data analysis and playback. The above features are provided by the open-source cisst software package, which forms the basis for the Surgical Assistant Workstation (SAW) framework. A complex computer-assisted intervention system for retinal microsurgery is presented as an example that relies on these features. This system integrates robotics, stereo microscopy, force sensing, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging to transcend the current limitations of vitreoretinal surgery.\n", "date_submitted": "2011-08-01 03:04:37", "publication_id": 813},

{"title": "Towards an open-source pipeline for patient-specific neurosurgery simulation", "abstract": "Surgery simulation is a technology based on interactive biomechanics as well as haptic and visual rendering for training novice surgeons. Another important component of a surgery simulator is the representation of a patient's anatomy in terms of simple shapes, typically triangles and tetrahedra, coinciding with relevant tissues, whose manipulation, cutting and resection is simulated. While this technology has so far emphasized generic simulators, increasingly researchers are emphasizing models that derive from the images of patients whose pathology collectively are predictive of a significant proportion of the future caseload of surgeons. In addition, our philosophy of producing patient-specific neurosurgery simulators is to organize the architecture in terms of two parameters: the choice of approach- pterional, trans-nasal, frontal and so on, and the nature of the pathology, which in turn determines the specific nature of the treatment and choice of tools. This paper describes on-going work on the refinement of an open-source software pipeline for producing patient-specific neurosurgery simulation, based on segmentation tools such as those available in Slicer and BrainVisa, surface and volume meshing, such as public VTK-based tools and Tetgen respectively, and the SOFA simulation platform.

Literature has attempted to incorporate haptic feedback\ndisplays to enhance and improve user performance. For example, Massimino et al. [4] showed that a combi-\nnation of vibrotactile and auditory substitutions lead to task performance (peg-in hole task) comparable to\nthat using a force feedback. Kitagawa et al. [5] extended this approach by using visual force displays and\nand auditory cues, in experiments showing comparable performance in surgical tasks (knot-tying). Reiley et\nal. [6] used a visual force display in a teleoperated knot-tying task to demonstrate lower forces and reduced\nsuture breakage by trainees.\nThe above art demonstrates the need for information overlays in telerobotic surgical tasks. However, this\nliterature also used prototype software and tools intended only for the speci\fc experiments. By contrast,\nwe use the Surgical Assistant Workstation (SAW) [7, 8] in development at Johns Hopkins University to\ncreate a general information overlay, and demonstrate its utility by creating a visual warning display for\ntelerobotic surgery that detects instruments being operated outside of the \feld of view of the endoscopic\ncamera. SAW is a modular framework for rapid prototyping of new tools and methods for robotic surgery. It\nincludes methods for image guidance, registration with pre-operative and intra-operative images, and ability\nto interact with the graphical objects rendered within the display with the master or slave manipulators in\na teleoperation environment.\nThe common telesurgical system in use is the da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical Inc.). It\nconsists of a surgeon's console containing the two master manipulators, a patient side cart with up to\nfour robotic arms - three for the slave instrument manipulators which can be equipped with the removable\ninstruments and an endoscope camera manipulator connected to a high-performance stereo vision system.\nThe da Vinci also provides a research and development application programming interface (DiMaio, et al.,\n[9]) that streams kinematics data and system events at con\fgurable rates of up to 100Hz. The SAW/cisst\nframework also contains an interface to the da Vinci API.\nWe present an overlay architecture (Figure 1) implemented using the cisst/SAW libraries to integrate\ncontextual procedure and system information for improving safety, and situational awareness during these\ndelicate and complex manipulations.

Over the past years, a considerable number of studies have been conducted on new medical ultrasound imaging modalities such as ultrasound-based elasticity imaging, photoacoustic imaging, thermal imaging, etc. Moreover, results of such advanced ultrasound research are readily integrated with Image Guided Therapy (IGT) systems due to the advantages of ultrasound imaging such as mobility and real-time data acquisition. For integrating two systems, a communication method between systems has to be devised. OpenIGTLink is a standardized TCP/IP-based protocol for the integration of medical imaging and IGT systems. However, OpenIGTLink is not sufficient for communicating between IGT and advanced ultrasound research systems, because OpenIGTLink does not define any message type for general ultrasound data and some results of ultrasound researching.\nIn this paper, we propose an extension to OpenIGTLink, called OpenIGTLinkMUSiiC, by adding new message types and new network classes. Our new message types are designed for containing raw ultrasound data, advanced ultrasound modalities, and text-based control parameters. The network classes of OpenIGTLinkMUSiiC improve upon the performance of existing network classes by implementing a multithread architecture.

{"title": "Robot assisted prostate surgery using augmented reality with deformable models", "abstract": "We present preliminary results of our work to develop an augmented display for improved visualization\nof the prostate and surrounding critical anatomy for robot-assisted prostate surgery. Prostate\ncancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men in the United States. Early stage\nprostate cancer is potentially cured by surgery, which can be performed in a traditional, open fashion\nor laparoscopically. Recently, robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) using the da\nVinci surgical robot system has gained wide acceptance. Robotic systems improve surgeon dexterity\nby incorporating additional degrees of freedom at the end of the tools and offer increased precision\nand stability of movements. However, since the procedure is performed through small incisions, this\ntechnique reduces free sight and tactile feedback compared to open surgery. Surgeons also lose the ability\nto palpate the prostate to locate tumors and other critical structures such as neurovascular bundles\n(NVB). Surgeons must rely on visual cues from the video monitor and mentally correlate them with\nthe underlying anatomy, often using information from medical images obtained prior to the procedure.\nFurther complications arise from local deformations in the prostate tissue that occurs throughout the\nprostatectomy procedure due to the interaction between the surgical instruments and the prostate tissue.\nSubsequently, the anatomical model generated pre-operatively will need to be updated during the procedure\nto reflect this deformation. To address the clinical need for more accurate and reliable guidance,\nwe are developing a navigation system that provides surgeons with an augmented reality (AR) view that\nfuses a pre-operative MRI model of the prostate, tumor and surrounding tissues with the da Vinci system\nlaparoscopic video, while compensating for non-rigid prostate tissue deformation using intra-operative\ntransrectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging.

{"title": "Statismo - A framework for PCA based statistical models", "abstract": "This paper describes the Statismo framework, which is a framework for PCA based statistical models.Statistical models are used to describe the variability of an object within a population, learned from a set of training samples. Originally developed to model shapes, statistical models are now increasingly used to model the variation in different kind of data, such as for example images, volumetric meshes or deformation fields. Statismo has been developed with the following main goals in mind: \n1) To provide generic tools for learning different kinds of PCA based statistical models, such as shape, appearance or deformations models. \n2) To make the exchange of such models easier among different research groups and to improve the reproducibility of the models. \n3) To allow for easy integration of new methods for model building into the framework. \nTo achieve the first goal, we have abstracted all the aspects that are specific to a given model and data representation, into a user defined class. This does not only make it possible to use Statismo to create different kinds of PCA models, but also allows Statismo to be used with any toolkit and data format. To facilitate data exchange, Statismo defines a storage format based on HDF5, which includes all the information necessary to use the model, as well as meta-data about the model creation, which helps to make model building reproducible. The last goal is achieved by providing a clear separation between data management, model building and model representation. In addition to the standard method for building PCA models, Statismo already includes two recently proposed algorithms for building conditional models, as well as convenience tools for facilitating cross-validation studies.\nAlthough Statismo has been designed to be independent of a particular toolkit, special efforts have been made to make it directly useful for VTK and ITK. Besides supporting model building for most data representations used by VTK and ITK, it also provides an ITK transform class, which allows for the integration of Statismo with the ITK registration framework.

Real-time synchronous data from multiple sources and bidirectional data communication are essential for integrating components in advanced US IGT research. We previously proposed the MUSiiC ToolKit [1], a modular real-time software toolkit, and OpenIGTLinkMUSiiC [2], a standard communication protocol extended from the OpenIGTLink library [3, 4].

{"title": "Next Generation of the JAVA Image Science Toolkit (JIST) Visualization and Validation", "abstract": "Modern medical imaging analyses often involve the concatenation of multiple steps, and neuroimaging analysis is no exception. The Java Image Science Toolkit (JIST) has provided a framework for both end users and engineers to synthesize processing modules into tailored, automatic multi-step processing pipelines (“layouts”) and rapid prototyping of module development. Since its release, JIST has facilitated substantial neuroimaging research and fulfilled much of its intended goal. However, key weaknesses must be addressed for JIST to more fully realize its potential and become accessible to an even broader community base. Herein, we identify three core challenges facing traditional JIST (JIST-I) and present the solutions in the next generation JIST (JIST-II). First, in response to community demand, we have introduced seamless data visualization; users can now click ‘show this data’ through the program interfaces and avoid the need to locating files on the disk. Second, as JIST is an open-source community effort by-design; any developer may add modules to the distribution and extend existing functionality for release. However, the large number of developers and different use cases introduced instability into the overall JIST-I framework, causing users to freeze on different, incompatible versions of JIST-I, and the JIST community began to fracture. JIST-II addresses the problem of compilation instability by performing continuous integration checks nightly to ensure community implemented changes do not negatively impact overall JIST-II functionality. Third, JIST-II allows developers and users to ensure that functionality is preserved by running functionality checks nightly using the continuous integration framework. With JIST-II, users can submit layout test cases and quality control criteria through a new GUI. These test cases capture all runtime parameters and help to ensure that the module produces results within tolerance, despite changes in the underlying architecture. These three “next generation” improvements increase the fidelity of the JIST framework and enhance utility by allowing researchers to more seamlessly and robustly build, manage, and understand medical image analysis processing pipelines.", "date_submitted": "2012-08-14 19:15:25", "publication_id": 874},

Although the organs are deformed by operative procedures during surgery, surgical navigation systems usually do not change the reference images that are taken prior to surgery. It is useful to generate deformed reference images during surgery while it progresses. We develop a skull base surgery navigation system that updates the preoperative images during surgery. To estimate the resected regions, our proposed system utilizes the positional information of the surgical tools that can be tracked by a surgical navigation system. Our proposed system reflects the bone removal on preoperative images by changing the voxel values of the preoperative images using the positional information of the tracked tools. The updated reference images are generated by visualizing the updated preoperative images using a volume rendering method. We evaluated the proposed system on a skull phantom created from CT images by a 3D printer. The experimental results showed that the proposed system updated the reference images in real time based on the surgical tasks including bone removal process. The accuracy of our proposed method was about 1 mm.

Skull stripping is performed using non-rigid registration of 5 atlas masks. Our tissue segmentation is based on an automatically trained kNN-classifier. Training samples were obtained by non-rigid registration of 5 manually labeled scans followed by a pruning step in feature space to remove any residual erroneously sampled tissue voxels. The kNN-classification incorporates voxel intensities from a T1-weighted scan and a FLAIR scan. The white matter lesion detection is based on an automatically determined threshold on the FLAIR scan.

First the skull is stripped using a model-based level set on T1-weighted inversion recovery images, then the brain ventricles and basal ganglia are segmented using the same method on T1-weighted images. The central white matter is segmented using a regular level set method but with high curvature regulation. To segment the cortical gray matter, a skeleton-based model is created by extracting the mid-surface of the gray matter from a preliminary segmentation using a threshold-based level set. An implicit model is then built by defining the thickness of the gray matter to be 2.7 mm. This model is incorporated into the level set framework and used to guide a second round more precise segmentation. Preliminary experiments show that the proposed method can provide relatively accurate results compared with the segmentation done by human observers.

{"title": "MAP–Based Framework for Segmentation of MR Brain Images Based on Visual Appearance and Prior Shape", "abstract": "We propose a new MAP-based technique for the unsupervised segmentation of different brain structures (white matter, gray matter, etc.) from T1-weighted MR brain images. In this paper, we follow a procedure like most conventional approaches, in which T1-weighted MR brain images and desired maps of regions (white matter, gray matter, etc.) are modeled by a joint Markov-Gibbs Random Field model (MGRF) of independent image signals and interdependent region labels. However, we specifically focus on the most accurate model identification that can be achieved. The proposed joint MGRF model accounts for the following three descriptors: i) a 1st-order visual appearance descriptor(empirical distribution of signal intensity), ii) a 3D probabilistic shape prior, and iii) a 3D spatially invariant 2nd-order homogeneity descriptor. To better specify the 1st-order visual appearance descriptor, each empirical distribution of signals is precisely approximated by a Linear Combination of Discrete Gaussians (LCDG) having both positive and negative components. The 3D probabilistic shape prior is learned using a subset of 3D co-aligned training T1-weighted MR brain images. The 2nd-order homogeneity descriptor is modeled by a 2nd-order translation and rotation invariant MGRF of 3D T1-weighted MR brain region labels with analytically estimated potentials. The initial segmentation, based on a 1st-order visual appearance and 3D probabilistic shape, is then iteratively refined using a 3D MGRF model with analytically estimated potentials.

{"title": "MR Brain Segmentation using Decision Trees", "abstract": "Segmentation of the human cerebrum from magnetic resonance images (MRI) into its component tissues has been a defining problem in medical imaging. Until recently, this has been solved as the tissue classification of the T1-weighted (T1-w) MRI, with numerous solutions for this problem having appeared in the literature. The clinical demands of understanding lesions, which are indistinguishable from gray matter in T1-w images, has necessitated the incorporation of T2-weighted Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) images to improve segmentation of the cerebrum. Many of the existing methods fail to handle the second data channel gracefully, because of assumptions about their model. In our new approach, we explore a model free algorithm which uses a classification technique based on ensembles of decision trees to learn the mapping from an image feature to the corresponding tissue label. We use corresponding image patches from a registered set of T1-w and FLAIR images with a manual segmentation to construct our decision\ntree ensembles.

The specific choice of these terms depends on the particular application and requires consideration of, for example, image content and imaging modalities. Following this view, the presented framework can be seen as a generalization of the demons algorithm in which two key aspects remain exchangeable: the force term (or registration function, according to the distance measure) and the regularizer (according to the smoothness condition). Moreover, two transformation models are realized: either a dense displacement field or a stationary velocity field to restrain the transformation to the space of diffeomorphisms.\n\nIn its current state, the framework includes implementations of forces based on the Sum of Squared Differences (SSD), Normalized Cross Correlation (NCC) and the demons algorithm as well as Gaussian, diffusion and elastic smoothing.

{"title": "Improvements in SlicerRT, the radiation therapy research toolkit for 3D Slicer", "abstract": "Purpose: Recent years have seen growing interest in adaptive radiation therapy (RT), but the existing software tools are not ideal for research use, as they are either expensive and closed proprietary applications or free open-source packages with limited scope, extensibility, reliability, or user support. To address these limitations, we have developed SlicerRT, an open-source toolkit for RT research, providing fast computations and user-friendly interface for researchers. It is a medium for RT researchers to integrate their workflows in, assists clinical translation of experimental approaches, and enables comparative testing.\n\nMethods: SlicerRT builds on the widely used medical image visualization and analysis platform, 3D Slicer (www.slicer.org). In addition to the tools that 3D Slicer offers for visualization, registration and segmentation, the toolkit provides functions specifically designed for RT research. Established development processes as well as testing and validation environment ensure software quality. Standardized software development mechanisms of 3D Slicer were applied for documentation, distribution, and user support. The design and architecture of the toolkit was outlined in [1]. SlicerRT has evolved to contain the most widely used features in the field (see www.slicerrt.org), which have been defined through consensus discussions with a large pool of RT researchers.\n\nResults: Numerous modules have been developed for RT-specific features such as DICOM-RT data import and export, as well as dose analysis tools including dose volume histogram, dose accumulation, dose comparison, and isodose line and surface generation. The toolkit also includes contour analysis modules for handling various contour representations, contour morphology, and contour comparison. Advanced registration tools are provided by the included Plastimatch library [2]. The main new features developed in the last year are RT plan and RT image import and the subject hierarchy module, which arranges the loaded data to a structure familiar to clinicians, while providing advanced automation features through the underlying extendible mechanism. The toolkit is being used by several research groups to support and evaluate adaptive radiation therapy workflows. SlicerRT is available for download through the Extension Manager component of 3D Slicer 4.3 or later (see instructions on our website).\n\nFuture work: As SlicerRT has matured to contain most of the planned functions, our focus has shifted from feature development to usability and stability. The subject hierarchy module, and its features such as bulk deformation of studies embodies our efforts toward usability, while the integration of the subject hierarchy and the advanced contour handling mechanism into the 3D Slicer core points towards stability, also benefiting the whole 3D Slicer community. There is ongoing work to evaluate and potentially standardize the way the 2D contours are rasterized into 3D volumes, thus mitigating the great variability between the different solutions for this problem. Current funding ensures continuous development for several years, so SlicerRT is expected to develop further.\n\nAcknowledgement: This work was in part funded by Cancer Care Ontario through Applied Cancer Research Unit and Research Chair in Cancer Imaging grants, and the Ontario Consortium for Adaptive Invention in Radiation Oncology (OCAIRO).\n", "date_submitted": "2014-10-22 14:06:23", "publication_id": 939},

Multi-modal image registration aligns images from different modalities like computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) into one common frame of reference. The gold standard validation methods are visual inspection by radiation oncology experts and fiducial-based evaluation. However, visual inspection is a qualitative measure with a range of 2-6 mm inaccuracy, it is time consuming and prone to errors. The fiducial-based evaluation is an invasive method when fiducial markers are fixated to bone or implanted in organs. Therefore, in clinical practice a robust non-invasive automated method is needed to validate registration of multi-modal images. \nThe aim of this study is to introduce and validate an automatic landmark-based accuracy measure for multi-modal image rigid registration using feature descriptors.

For these systems, dose painting can be used for conformal dose delivery, but is significantly slower than a multi-leaf collimator. As a compromise solution, a variable rectangular collimator has been developed for the Small Animal Radiation Research Platform (SARRP). This enables more efficient dose painting via the decomposition of a 2D target region into a minimum number of rectangles of variable size, which is the topic of this paper.

{"title": "Pseudo-CT generation from multiple MR images for small animal irradiation", "abstract": "Introduction. Computed tomography (CT) is the standard imaging modality for radiation therapy treatment planning (RTTP) because of its ability to provide information on electron density. However, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging provides superior soft tissue contrast, especially in small animal imaging, facilitating the precise selection of the target volume. This makes the technique interesting for irradiation of brain tumors. The aim of this study was to present an MR-only based workflow for RTTP on a small animal radiation research platform (SARRP) by investigating the potential of probabilistic classification of voxels using multiple MR sequences.\nMethods. Six female Fisher rats were anesthetized using isoflurane and individually fixed on an in-house made multimodality bed before starting MR and CT acquisitions. MR measurements were performed on a 7-Tesla system using a rat brain volume coil. Four different MR sequences were acquired for each animal, including a T1-weighted (MDEFT) sequence, a T2-weighted (RARE) sequence, an ultra-short echo time sequence with 20 μs echo time (UTE1) and an ultra- short echo time sequence with 2 ms echo time (UTE2). UTE offers the opportunity to acquire images from proton-poor structures with very short transverse relaxation times, such as bone, by using a rapid readout of the fast decaying signal. Following MR, the animals were moved to the SARRP to start a cone-beam CT (CB-CT) by acquiring 720 projections over 360°. Cone-beam CT projection data were reconstructed by filtered back-projection to obtain the standard-CT for RTTP. Then the images were bias field corrected and manually co-registered to the CB-CT. After that, images were segmented in three tissue classes (air, soft tissue and bone) with k-means for the CB-CT and fuzzy c-means segmentation algorithm (FCM) for the MR images with multiple MR images as input. The membership probability can be between 0 and 1, with one indicating 100% probability and zero indicating 0% probability to belong to a specific tissue class. To obtain a pseudo-CT image, voxels were assigned to the tissue class having the highest membership probability. The dice coefficient was used to evaluate the correctness of the segmentation for soft-tissue and bone. The pseudo-CT images with the highest similarity index were used for further radiotherapy treatment planning (RTTP), in addition, to the standard UTE1-UTE2. The target of the RTTP that was selected in the primary cortex (M1) and three different beam arrangements were investigated to compare CB-CT and MR-based dose calculations. The dose plans were a single static beam of 3x3 mm, using a single arc (3x3 mm beam size, 120° arc, couch at 0°), and three non-coplanar arcs (3x3 mm beam size, 120° arc, couch at 0°, 45° and 90°). Dose distributions were calculated using the TPS of the SARRP and cumulative dose volume histograms (DVHs) of the target and normal brain tissue were obtained for the three dose plans.\nResults The highest dice coefficient was obtained for the T1-UTE1-T2 combination, which was used for further RTTP. The contribution of bone to the total dice coefficient did not exceed 27%. However, bone accounts for only 2% of the image, therefore a misclassified bone pixel has a bigger effect in the dice coefficient than a misclassified soft tissue pixel. Using only 1 beam, both MR combinations underestimate the dose to be delivered to the target. When more complex beam configurations were used to irradiate the target, very small differences were observed between CB-CT and MR based dose calculations.", "date_submitted": "2014-11-05 03:10:07", "publication_id": 948},

Mapping of diffusion tensors is a challenging process, and existing methods fail to account for the major changes that take place between 30 and 40 weeks equivalent gestational age. In this paper we introduce the spectral matching in the context of non-linear registration of diffusion images. Spatial correspondences are defined with respect to the main spectral modes of the images, which are global descriptors of the tensor information. We apply tensor spectral matching (TSM) in two different ways: by estimation of spatial correspondences uniquely based on the spectral decomposition of diffusion tensor images, and by combination of TSM with a standard diffusion tensor registration algorithm (TSM-DTI-TK). We validate the proposed approaches on 20 adult controls, and we compare it to the state-of-art registration method. We then apply these methods to longitudinal diffusion data acquired from 6 extremely preterm-born infants scanned shortly after birth and at term equivalent age. The experimental results combining TSM with standard tensor registration outperform the state-of-art when applied to both adult and preterm data. Having a reliable anatomical correspondence in preterm infants allows us to quantify microstructural changes and to work towards developing biomarkers of neurological impairment.", "date_submitted": "2015-10-12 08:34:26", "publication_id": 961},

{"title": "Integration of the Java Image Science Toolkit with E-Science Platform", "abstract": "Medical image analyses rely on diverse software packages assembled into a “pipeline”. The Java Image Science Toolkit (JIST) has served as a standalone plugin into the Medical Image Processing Analysis and Visualization (MIPAV). We addressed shortcomings that previously prevented deeper integration of JIST with other E-science platforms. First, we developed an interface for integrating externally compiled packages (similar to the interfaces in NiPy) such that the application can become a “draggable module” in the module tree. This allows for connection of inputs and outputs to other JIST modules while maintaining external processing and monitoring. Second, we develop an integration interface with the Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resources Clearinghouse Cloud Environment (NITRC-CE). User can launch and terminate pre-configured nodes to utilize computational resources of the Amazon cloud. Finally, we define a new external data source, which can connect to the eXtensible Neuroimaging Archive Toolkit (XNAT) to query and retrieve remote data using XNAT's REST API. Specifically, we define dataflow for files that can readily be converted into volumes and collections of volumes to interface with any JIST module that expects volumetric image data as an input. Users now have the ability to run their pipelines from a well-defined external data source and no longer are required to already have data on the disk. With these upgrades we have extended JIST’s capabilities outside of complied java source code and enhanced capabilities to seamlessly interface with E-science platforms.

Qualitative and quantitative evaluations are performed on a set of 15 testing images. As shown by the results, mandible, brainstem and parotid glands are segmented accurately (mean volume DSC>0.8).

The model adaptation to a test image is done with respect to the appearance of its items and the trained articulation space. Even on very challenging data sets with unnatural postures, which occur far more often than expected, the model adaptation algorithm succeeds.\nThe approach is based on an articulated atlas \\cite{Steger2012a}, that is trained from a set of manually labeled training samples. Furthermore, we have combined the initial solution with statistical shape models \\cite{Kirschner2011} to represent structures with high shape variation.

{"title": "A new implementation of itk::ImageToImageFilter for efficient parallelization of image processing algorithms using Intel Threading Building Blocks", "abstract": "Modern medical imaging makes use of high performance computing to accelerate image acquisition, image reconstruction, image visualization and image analysis. Software libraries that provide implementations of key medical imaging algorithms need to efficiently exploit modern CPU architectures. In particular, workstations with small numbers of cores are being replaced by very high core count architectures, and by many integrated core architectures, which offer acceleration by vectorization and multi-threading.\n\nThe Insight Toolkit (ITK) is the premier open source implementation of medical imaging algorithms, with a generic design for image processing filters that allows for many developers to rapidly incorporate these algorithms in to new applications. While ITK filters benefit from a generic, platform independent multithreading capability, the current implementation is difficult to exploit to achieve very high performance. Specifically, ITK relies on a static decomposition of the image into subsets of equal size which can be highly inefficient. Threads that terminate early due to uneven work throughout the image finish early and do not contribute further to the processing of more complex regions, leading to idle computational resources and longer execution times. Performance is also difficult to coordinate across multiple algorithms, as the ITK filter assumes each filter operates independently but the global implementation has an impact across filters. \n\nIn this work, we propose a novel, simple to use, high performance multithreading capability for ITK that accelerates the itk::ImageToImageFilter. We utilise a workpile data decomposition strategy, and leave the task of optimal job scheduling on CPU cores to the library called Threading Building Blocks (TBB). We demonstrate the efficacy of multi-threading with TBB in comparison to the itk::Multithreader class, through three simple example image analysis algorithms. \n\nOur implementation provides a new multi-threaded itk::ImageToImageFilter that can be conveniently reused to provide simple and efficient multi-threaded code across applications and algorithm libraries.

First, ITK relies on a static decomposition of the image into subsets of equal size which is highly inefficient when the computational complexity varies between subsets (unbalanced workloads). Second, the current domain decomposition is limited to subdivide the input domain along a single dimension (typically the slice dimension in a 3-D volume), which causes a multithreading under-utilization when the number of threads is larger than the size of this dimension when using massively parallel compute systems.
